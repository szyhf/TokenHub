# TokenHub Documentation

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/README.md) | [日本語](ja/README.md)

TokenHub documentation is organized around the three roles used in enterprise Token Governance. The default documentation language is English. Localized Chinese and Japanese versions use the same English screenshots and the same English sample data set.

## Architecture and Deployment

- [Architecture](architecture.md): deployment modes, control and data planes, model request flow, persistence, and security boundaries.
- [Deployment](deployment.md): Docker Compose, environment variables, databases, reverse proxying, and health checks.
- [Database Evolution](database-evolution.md): forward-only migrations, adoption baseline, maintenance commands, and rollback compatibility.
- [PostgreSQL Setup Guide](postgresql-setup.md): PostgreSQL configuration, operations, and migration.
- [Performance Benchmarking](performance-benchmarking.md): reproducible gateway comparisons, internal allocation benchmarks, and regression budgets.

- [TypeSafe / Jev integration](typesafe.md)

## Plugin Platform

- [Plugin Development](plugin-development/README.md): start here for the Plugin Devkit, examples, manifest reference, family guides, packaging, and the complete architecture guide.

## Shared English Sample Data

The examples and screenshots use one English data set so every language version stays visually consistent:

| Object | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Organization | Acme AI Platform |
| Team | Platform Engineering |
| Project | Payments Assistant |
| Cost center | AI Platform Cost Center |
| Model | gpt-4.1-mini |
| API key placeholder | YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY |

## Screenshot Set

Product screenshots are captured from the English UI. The Codex guides use the same real, redacted terminal screenshots in every language version.

| Screen | File |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway documentation | `assets/screenshots/gateway-en.png` |
| Overview | `assets/screenshots/overview-en.png` |
| Models | `assets/screenshots/models-en.png` |
| Routes | `assets/screenshots/routes-en.png` |
| Usage | `assets/screenshots/usage-en.png` |
| Settings | `assets/screenshots/settings-en.png` |
| Codex Profile configuration | `assets/codex-profile/tokenhub-profile-config-redacted.png` |
| Codex Profile status | `assets/codex-profile/codex-status-redacted.png` |

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Start with the guide that matches your role.
2. Read the “Concepts” section in the in-app API Documentation page if you need shared vocabulary.
3. Use the API examples in the User Guide for application integration.
4. Review the Administrator Guide before production rollout.
