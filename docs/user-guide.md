# User LLM API Guide

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/user-guide.md) | [日本語](ja/user-guide.md)

This guide is for employees and application developers who call approved large language models through TokenHub.

## What You Need

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | OpenAI-compatible root `http://localhost:8080/v1`; Claude Code host `http://localhost:8080` |
| Project API Key | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY` |
| Model ID | Returned by `GET /v1/models` and used as the `model` field |
| Request ID | Used in Request Logs when troubleshooting failures |

Console login tokens cannot call model APIs. Use a project API key from **Key Management**.

## Call Sequence

1. Open **Key Management** and create or copy an API key. New keys are shown only once.
2. TokenHub automatically attributes a personal key to an assigned project, or to the platform default project when none is assigned.
3. Call `GET /v1/models` to see the model list available to that key.
4. Use one model ID in `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/messages`, `POST /v1/responses`, `POST /v1/embeddings`, or `POST /v1/rerank`.
5. Review **Usage Analytics** and **Request Logs** for requests, tokens, cost, and errors.

The console **API Documentation** page remains the guided onboarding view. For the complete interactive and machine-readable gateway contract, open `http://localhost:8080/docs` in a private deployment or import `http://localhost:8080/openapi.json` into an API client, SDK generator, test tool, or enterprise API catalog. The documentation page keeps any entered project key in browser memory only.

## Copy Connection Details and Rotate a Key

In **Key Management**, select **Use** on a key to see the protocol, Base URL, authentication header, and an expandable cURL example. OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses use `/v1`; Anthropic uses the gateway root as its client Base URL and `/v1/messages` for requests; Gemini uses the gateway root as its client Base URL, `/v1beta` request paths, and `x-goog-api-key`. Do not append `/v1beta` to the Gemini client Base URL. Use the configured gateway address, not the console's port. Enter a model ID permitted by the project and key before running an example.

Creating a key opens this setup window automatically with the complete key, ready to copy. Save it before closing: the full key is shown only once. Reopening **Use** shows a placeholder; replace it with your saved key. The console does not store the full key in browser storage.

**Rotate** first asks for confirmation and identifies the affected key. Canceling leaves it unchanged. Confirming immediately revokes the old key and opens the setup window with the new key after a successful response. Update applications using the old key. Rotation errors are displayed without a success window.

## Review One API Key's Usage

In **Key Management**, select **Usage** for a Key to open its dedicated usage page. The page reports requests, success rate, latency, detailed token categories, estimated client cost, model and error breakdowns, and paginated request details. Use the 7-, 30-, or 90-day presets, or select a custom UTC range of up to 366 days.

The quota section compares the current UTC day and month counters with the effective limits after Key, Project, Team, and global quota policies are combined. Usage belongs only to the selected saved Key ID. A rotated predecessor or successor is shown as related information but is never merged into the totals. Request payloads, when audit capture is enabled, follow the existing redaction and truncation rules; the complete API Key is never returned.

## Test a Model in the Playground

Open **Model Playground** in the console to test an available chat model without creating an API script. Each response shows streaming or buffered delivery, TTFT when it can be measured, output throughput, total duration, full-context input tokens, output tokens, estimated cost, local completion time, and a request ID. Expand the response for the actual response details. Provider and route internals appear only when your role has routing-read permission.

Image upload is available only when the selected model's `input_modalities` includes `image`; configure this value in the model directory for multimodal models. The Playground accepts JPEG, PNG, and WebP images, with limits of 4 images per message, 5 MiB per image, and 12 MiB of images across the current conversation. Exported sessions retain image names, media types, and sizes for context, but omit the image data.

The session is temporary and remains only on the current page unless you choose **Export Playground**. **Stop** keeps partial output. **Rerun** creates another candidate from that turn and removes later turns. Changing models starts a new session unless you explicitly choose to keep the existing context. For an upstream that does not support streaming, the page uses buffered mode and marks TTFT as not applicable.

## List Models

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/models" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Typical model fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Model identifier used in API calls |
| `object` | Object type, usually `model` |
| `created` | Model creation Unix timestamp |
| `input_token_price_per_m` | JieKou-compatible integer input price per million tokens |
| `output_token_price_per_m` | JieKou-compatible integer output price per million tokens |
| `title` | Model title |
| `display_name` | Anthropic-compatible display name |
| `description` | Model description |
| `context_size` | Maximum context window |
| `created_at` | Anthropic-compatible RFC 3339 creation timestamp |
| `max_input_tokens` | Anthropic-compatible maximum input context |
| `max_tokens` | Configured maximum output tokens, or `0` when unspecified |

## Retrieve Model

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/models/gpt-4.1-mini" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This returns one model object using the same fields as `GET /v1/models`.

## Chat Completions

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are an internal enterprise AI assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize today'\''s support tickets."}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "stream": false
  }'
```

Common request fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | Yes | Must be available in `GET /v1/models` |
| `messages` | Yes | `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message list |
| `max_tokens` | No | Maximum generated tokens |
| `max_completion_tokens` | No | OpenAI-compatible maximum generated tokens; when both token-limit fields are present, TokenHub uses the larger value |
| `temperature` | No | Sampling temperature |
| `reasoning_effort` | No | Reasoning effort for models and routes that support it |
| `stream` | No | `true` returns Server-Sent Events |
| `tools` | No | Function tools when supported by the upstream model |
| `response_format` | No | JSON object or JSON schema when supported |

### Reasoning effort

Chat Completions accepts the OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` field:

```json
{
  "model": "REASONING_MODEL_ID",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze the trade-offs."}],
  "reasoning_effort": "high"
}
```

Responses accepts the nested OpenAI-compatible form:

```json
{
  "model": "REASONING_MODEL_ID",
  "input": "Analyze the trade-offs.",
  "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}
}
```

TokenHub treats reasoning effort as a best-effort hint and does not change route ordering. OpenAI-compatible providers receive the value unchanged. Native Anthropic routes convert supported values to `output_config.effort`. Native Gemini routes convert supported values according to the model-specific `thinkingLevel` matrix for Gemini 3 and later models or the documented `thinkingBudget` for Gemini 2.5 models. Unsupported or blank values are omitted so the upstream model default remains in effect. If an upstream provider returns a `400` or `422` parameter error that explicitly identifies the effort field, TokenHub retries the same route once without that field. A `400` or `422` that is not an effort rejection is reported to you rather than retried elsewhere: a request the upstream considers malformed is malformed at every provider. Each physical retry counts toward Provider Resource RPM and appears as a route attempt.

Responses reasoning effort is supported on OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and Gemini routes. Azure OpenAI Responses and streaming Responses are not implemented; those requests return `501 provider_capability_not_supported`.

## Tool calling and multimodal content on Anthropic and Gemini routes

Chat Completions requests routed to a native Anthropic or Gemini provider translate the whole request and response, not only plain text.

| Capability | Anthropic | Gemini |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools` and `tool_choice` | Supported | Supported |
| Assistant `tool_calls` and `role: "tool"` results | Supported | Supported |
| `parallel_tool_calls: false` | Supported | `501 provider_capability_not_supported` |
| Image content parts | `http(s)` URLs and base64 data URIs | Base64 data URIs only |
| Streaming | Incremental relay | Incremental relay |

Streaming forwards upstream events as they arrive, so time to first token reflects the provider rather than the full response. Content types these routes cannot represent, such as audio parts, return `400 unsupported_content_block` instead of being dropped from the request.

Chat Completions routed to a Codex Subscription account use the Responses protocol internally and provide the same text, image, function-tool, parallel-tool, reasoning-continuation, and streaming behavior.

The Codex subscription upstream does not accept client sampling, output-token-limit, or stop-sequence fields. TokenHub accepts those fields at the compatibility endpoint but omits them from the subscription request, so `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, and stop conditions are not enforced on Codex-backed routes. Use a standard API Provider when those controls are contractual.

### Reasoning continuation

Anthropic and Gemini require the opaque signature attached to a reasoning step to be echoed back verbatim on the next turn of a multi-step tool exchange. The OpenAI Chat Completions schema has no field for it, so TokenHub returns the data in extension fields:

| Field | Provider data |
| --- | --- |
| `message.reasoning_content` | Anthropic `thinking` text, Gemini thought parts, Codex reasoning summaries |
| `message.reasoning_signature` | Anthropic `thinking.signature`, Codex encrypted reasoning |
| `message.reasoning_details` | Codex encrypted reasoning bound to a tool call ID |
| `message.redacted_reasoning_content` | Anthropic `redacted_thinking.data` |
| `message.tool_calls[].thought_signature` | Gemini `thoughtSignature` |

Echo these fields on the assistant message of the following request to preserve reasoning continuity. For `reasoning_details`, preserve the complete item and its `id`; TokenHub accepts it only when that ID matches a tool call in the same assistant message. Clients that ignore these fields still work: TokenHub omits the reasoning block rather than replaying a signature the provider would reject. Signatures are tagged with the provider that issued them and are never replayed to a different provider.

## Anthropic Messages and Claude Code

TokenHub exposes `POST /v1/messages` and `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` for Claude Code and Anthropic-compatible clients. Use a project key as a bearer token:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/messages" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "CLAUDE_COMPATIBLE_MODEL_ID",
    "max_tokens": 2048,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Understand this repository and summarize its architecture."}
    ]
  }'
```

Native Anthropic routes preserve Anthropic content blocks and beta headers. OpenAI-compatible routes translate text, images, client tools, tool results, parallel tool calls, and streaming events. Anthropic server tools that cannot be represented by an OpenAI-compatible provider return `400 unsupported_tool`.

For OpenAI-compatible routes, Provider and Provider Resource `options` can adapt Claude reasoning controls to the upstream vocabulary. `reasoning_effort_map` is a JSON object such as `{"minimal":"low","xhigh":"max"}`; `reasoning_effort_values` is a comma-separated allowlist; `reasoning_effort_unsupported` is `omit` (default), `reject`, or the explicitly opted-in `passthrough`; and `reasoning_budget_map` maps maximum token counts plus optional `*` fallback to effort values, for example `{"2048":"low","8192":"medium","*":"max"}`. Resource options override Provider options. TokenHub translates `thinking.type=disabled` to `none`, leaves `adaptive` at the upstream default unless an explicit effort exists, and maps `enabled` with `budget_tokens`. An explicit `output_config.effort` overrides top-level `effort` and the budget-derived value. Set `preserve_reasoning_content=true` only when the upstream accepts its own `reasoning_content` on later assistant messages. OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_content` is returned to Claude clients as ordered `thinking` / `thinking_delta` blocks with a TokenHub replay signature.

Models routed to an OpenAI Codex Subscription account work through the same Messages endpoint: TokenHub translates Messages directly to the Responses protocol and converts the result back to Anthropic events. Claude Code therefore connects to TokenHub directly; CC-Switch or another local protocol proxy is not required. Codex-issued reasoning signatures are carried across tool turns, and a Claude Code session remains affined to one healthy subscription account.

On Codex-backed Messages routes, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop_sequences`, and Anthropic structured-output formatting cannot be enforced because the subscription upstream does not support their equivalent request fields.

Claude Code requests that enable `mid-conversation-system-2026-04-07` may include `system` entries inside `messages`. TokenHub preserves those entries on native Anthropic routes and translates them into ordered system messages on OpenAI-compatible routes. Without that beta, `messages` continues to accept only `user` and `assistant` roles.

Configure local Claude Code with the TokenHub host URL, without the `/v1` suffix:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="CLAUDE_COMPATIBLE_MODEL_ID"

claude
```

`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` sends the TokenHub key in `Authorization: Bearer`. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` also works through `x-api-key` when no Authorization header is present. Token counting verifies key and model access but does not create a billed inference record.

## Persistent background Responses

Set `background: true` on `POST /v1/responses` to persist a Responses request and return a stable gateway-owned response ID immediately:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-5.4","input":"Summarize the report","background":true}'
```

Read the status or final response with `GET /v1/responses/{id}`. Request cancellation with `POST /v1/responses/{id}/cancel`. Reads and cancellation require the same project, API key, attributed owner, and current model access as the original submission; a mismatch returns `404`. `background: true` with `stream: true` is rejected because resumable background SSE is not implemented.

The public status values are `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, and `cancelled`. Quota, budget, concurrency, routing, guardrails, cache affinity, cost accounting, request logs, and traces are applied by the worker before and during the upstream call. A cancellation/completion race has one durable winner, while any upstream usage already incurred is still settled exactly once.

Queued work survives a server restart. Work whose lease expires before admission is safely returned to the queue. Work that loses its worker after admission is marked `failed` with `response_execution_lost` instead of being replayed, because the provider may already have received it. PostgreSQL replicas coordinate claims with fenced leases and row locking. SQLite supports restart recovery but remains a single-backend deployment; do not share one SQLite file between backend replicas.

Request envelopes and results are encrypted at rest with `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`; authentication headers are never stored, and only a bounded protocol-header allowlist is retained. Background request and response bodies are not copied to plaintext request-payload audit records or tracing exports, and upstream route error text is removed from their route-attempt records. Encryption or decryption failure is fail-closed. Terminal payloads are retained for `TOKENHUB_RESPONSE_RESULT_TTL_SECONDS`, then both request and result ciphertext are scrubbed and later reads return `404`. The returned ID is a TokenHub retrieval ID and is not translated into an upstream `previous_response_id`.

Prometheus exposes `tokenhub_gateway_response_jobs_queued`, `tokenhub_gateway_response_job_queue_wait_seconds`, `tokenhub_gateway_response_job_execution_seconds`, `tokenhub_gateway_response_jobs_total`, and `tokenhub_gateway_response_job_recoveries_total` when metrics are enabled. Worker concurrency, polling, timeout, lease, retention, and queue limits are listed in [Deployment](deployment.md#backend-environment-variables).

## Gemini CLI with Codex subscription GPT

Gemini CLI can connect directly to TokenHub's native Gemini `v1beta` surface and use a GPT model routed to an OpenAI Codex Subscription account. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` to a TokenHub project key, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` to the TokenHub host without `/v1beta`, and select the routed GPT model. CCswitch is not required. See [Use Codex Subscription GPT from Gemini CLI](gemini-cli-codex-subscription.md) for isolated and project-local configuration, supported endpoints, verification, and limitations.

## Codex subscription image generation

`POST /v1/images/generations` accepts the OpenAI-compatible `model`, `prompt`, `quality`, `size`, `n`, and `response_format` fields. Use the public virtual model `model: "codex-gpt-image-2"` and `n: 1`. `gpt-image-2` normally remains a separate standard API model. As a narrow compatibility exception, TokenHub maps a generation request marked by a Codex `originator` or `x-codex-image-turn-id` header to `codex-gpt-image-2` and returns `b64_json`; the API key must allow `codex-gpt-image-2`. Add `Prefer: respond-async` to receive an image job, then poll `GET /v1/image-jobs/{id}`.

`POST /v1/images/edits` normally accepts up to 16 multipart reference images in `image` or `image[]`. As a narrow native-client exception, requests marked by a configured image-alias header or originator prefix may use `application/json` with Base64 data URLs in `images[].image_url`. For Codex-marked JSON edits, TokenHub maps `gpt-image-2` to `codex-gpt-image-2` and always returns `b64_json`; each decoded image is limited to 50 MB and the whole request to 128 MB. Ordinary JSON clients still receive `415 invalid_content_type`. `gpt-image-2` forwards one multipart `mask` to the OpenAI API; mask edits are not available through Codex subscription accounts. TokenHub sends image requests directly to the Codex subscription Images endpoint without installing or starting Codex CLI, keeps prompts encrypted in the database, retains input and output images on the server, and returns signed download URLs valid for 24 hours. The files remain stored after a URL expires; polling the job creates a new URL. The selected Codex account must have image-generation entitlement.

Image jobs have a five-minute default execution timeout controlled by `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

Administrators configure this capability in **Provider Channels**: open an OpenAI Codex Provider, select the **Models** tab, and check **Codex subscription image generation**. After an active account is selected, TokenHub displays a quota warning and sends that real account one low-quality `gpt-image-2` request. Only a non-empty, valid image result records the account as supported and creates or re-enables the Provider route. A `403` result records the account as unsupported; expired credentials require reauthorization; rate limits, timeouts, and transient upstream failures can be retried from the dialog without overwriting the previous capability result. The test consumes a small amount of subscription quota, and TokenHub never runs it in the background.

The checkbox idempotently manages an active route from `codex-gpt-image-2` to the OpenAI Codex Provider with upstream model `gpt-image-2`. An upgrade performs a one-time backfill for active accounts already confirmed as supported. Clearing the checkbox disables matching routes but retains the account capability result. Startup backfill does not reactivate an explicitly disabled route or recreate a route deleted after its migration marker; an administrator can explicitly test and enable it again. Advanced priority, weight, project scope, resource, and resource-group controls remain editable in routing. With an active route, supported accounts are preferred and an account returning `403` is temporarily skipped. After `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_CAPABILITY_RETRY_SECONDS` (24 hours by default), it becomes eligible for a low-frequency retry on the next real request. An initial failed test that created no route must be retried manually. `codex-gpt-image-2` appears in `GET /v1/models` only when an eligible route and account exist. Except for the Codex-client compatibility mapping above, the separate `gpt-image-2` catalog model uses an OpenAI API Provider and does not consume Codex subscription quota.

## SDK Setup

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.TOKENHUB_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "http://localhost:8080/v1",
});
```

## Troubleshooting

| Status | Likely cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | Missing, malformed, disabled, or expired API key | Check `Authorization` and key status |
| 403 | Project, key, or model permission does not allow the request | Ask your team leader to check project membership and model access |
| 404/503 | No enabled healthy route can serve the model | Ask an administrator to check routes and provider health |
| 429 | Quota, concurrency, or provider resource limit reached | Wait for reset or request a quota increase |
| 500 | Upstream provider or routing error | Search `request_id` in Request Logs |
