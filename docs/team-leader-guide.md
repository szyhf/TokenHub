# Team LLM API Rollout Guide

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/team-leader-guide.md) | [日本語](ja/team-leader-guide.md)

This guide is for team leaders who help applications call approved large language models through project-scoped TokenHub API keys.

## Team Leader Responsibility

| Area | What to manage |
| --- | --- |
| Project | Own the boundary for members, keys, quota, and cost attribution |
| Members | Add the application owner or developer to the project member panel |
| API Keys | Issue keys under the project that should own usage and cost |
| Models | Verify the key can see the intended model list |
| Reports | Review usage by member, project, model, and cost center |

## Collaborate Across Teams

A project can link multiple teams. The project's **primary team** remains the single accountable team for default ownership, cost attribution, and approval responsibility. The project owner also remains a single user. Linking another team grants access; it does not copy the project's API keys, model permissions, quota, budget, or routing policy.

Each linked team has one project role:

| Team project role | Effective permission |
| --- | --- |
| `viewer` | View the project and its permitted reports |
| `developer` | Viewer access plus issuing a project key owned by the current user |
| `maintainer` | Developer access plus project, member, and key management allowed by the user's console role |

Direct project membership and every linked-team role are merged deterministically: `owner` > `maintainer` > `developer` > `viewer`. A user who belongs to several linked teams receives the highest role. Administrators manage a user's primary and additional memberships in **User Management**. Existing single-team projects migrate in compatibility mode, which preserves access for their team leader without granting new access to ordinary same-team users; an administrator can replace that compatibility role in Project Details.

In **Project Spaces**, select a project and use **Linked Teams** to add a team, change its role, or remove it. Access changes take effect on the next request. Only active teams can be assigned to users or newly linked to projects; disabling a linked team immediately stops its project role from granting access. The primary team cannot be removed until another primary team is assigned, the last linked team cannot be removed, and a team referenced by a project or user cannot be deleted.

The management API exposes the same operations:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/projects/{project_id}/teams?limit=50&offset=0` | List linked teams with pagination |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/projects/{project_id}/teams` | Link `{ "team_id": "...", "role": "viewer|developer|maintainer" }` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/admin/projects/{project_id}/teams/{team_id}` | Change the linked team's role |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/projects/{project_id}/teams/{team_id}` | Remove a non-primary, non-last team link |

## Connect Your Own Provider Channel

Team leaders can register their own upstream LLM configuration as a team-owned Provider Channel instead of asking an administrator to file one on their behalf.

1. Open **Provider Channels** and create the Provider with your upstream Base URL and API key. The channel is stamped with your team automatically; a requested `owner_team_id` is ignored for team leaders.
2. Import the upstream model inventory during creation or afterwards. Importing inventory does not expose anything to callers by itself.
3. Add Provider Resources (accounts) under the channel when you need multiple keys, weights, or cooldown isolation.
4. Everything is scoped to your team: you only see, edit, test, and delete your own channels and resources, and neither platform channels nor other teams' channels are visible or manageable.

Upstream access policy applies to your channels exactly as it does to platform channels: private or loopback addresses are rejected unless the administrator allows them, and provider creation reusing an existing Provider ID is refused. Deleting a channel removes its routes, imported models, resources, and observations together, so clear dependent routes first if you plan to re-create them.

## Roll Out a Project Key

1. Create or select a project in **Project Spaces**.
2. Click the project and add the application owner in the right-side member panel.
3. Open **Key Management** and create the key under that project.
4. Limit the key to the models and quota needed by the application.
5. Validate the key with `GET /v1/models`.
6. Hand the key to the application owner through your internal secret process.

## Validate Available Models

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/models" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer PROJECT_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

The returned `data[].id` values are the model IDs the application can use.

## Validate Chat Calls

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer PROJECT_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a concise project onboarding checklist."}
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

## Governance Checks

| Check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Project owner | Usage and cost need a clear owner |
| Member role | Only trusted project members should issue or rotate keys |
| Model scope | The key should expose only the models the application needs |
| Quota | Quota and concurrency should match expected traffic |
| Logs | Failed calls should be traceable by `request_id` |

## Common Errors

| Status | Team leader action |
| --- | --- |
| 401 | Confirm the application uses the active project key |
| 403 | Check project membership and allowed model scope |
| 429 | Review quota, concurrency, and key/project limits |
| 503 | Ask an administrator to check route and provider health |
| 500 | Use `request_id` in Request Logs to inspect the upstream error |
