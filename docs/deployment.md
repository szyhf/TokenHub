# Deployment

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/deployment.md) | [日本語](ja/deployment.md)

TokenHub is designed for private deployment with a Go backend, a Next.js admin console, and support for SQLite or PostgreSQL persistence.

## Database Selection

TokenHub supports two database backends:

The commands below use Docker Compose. Both backends are equally supported without Docker; see [Native Release with systemd](#native-release-with-systemd).

### SQLite (Default)

**Advantages:**
- Zero configuration, no separate database service required
- Suitable for small to medium deployments
- Simple backups (direct file copy)

**Use cases:**
- Development and testing environments
- Deployments with fewer than 1000 users
- Single-server deployments

**Deployment:**

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```

### PostgreSQL (Production Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- Enterprise-grade database for high concurrency scenarios
- Better transaction support and data integrity
- Supports replication and high availability

**Use cases:**
- Production environments
- Deployments with more than 1000 users
- High-availability requirements

**Deployment:**

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```

For detailed PostgreSQL configuration, see the [PostgreSQL Setup Guide](postgresql-setup.md).

### Multi-instance deployment with remote PostgreSQL

The default installation starts one frontend and one backend with SQLite. For horizontal scaling with PostgreSQL managed outside this Compose project, use `deploy/docker-compose.remote-postgres.yml`. It adds an Nginx gateway in front of scalable backend and frontend services and does not start a local database.

    local -.-> rule
    providerCatalog -.-> rule
    rule -->|"Create matching Route"| postgres
```

In multi-instance mode:

- Nginx load-balances console, API, and health-check traffic across healthy replicas.
- Nginx routes `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, and `/openapi.yaml` to the backend so the self-hosted public gateway API reference uses the same public origin as model API calls.
- Backend replicas keep durable configuration, OAuth sessions, quota buckets, audit data, cluster locks, and in-flight concurrency leases in PostgreSQL.
- Lease expiry and ownership decisions use the PostgreSQL clock, avoiding early takeover caused by clock skew between hosts. Heartbeats cancel work when lease ownership is lost.
- Candidate-model metadata from the configured model catalog is synchronized on every backend startup; a cluster lease serializes the idempotent synchronization across replicas.
- Provider templates and candidate models are read from the tracked local provider catalog; runtime configuration does not depend on a remote catalog service.
- The backend persists a local Provider-catalog snapshot in PostgreSQL, so replicas serve the same catalog and a missing local file falls back to the seeded built-in templates.
- Coordination failures release provider capacity without incorrectly marking a healthy model provider as failed.

Set the remote `TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL`, public gateway URL, production secrets, trusted proxy CIDR, and the desired `TOKENHUB_BACKEND_REPLICAS` and `TOKENHUB_FRONTEND_REPLICAS` values in `deploy/.env`, then run:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.remote-postgres.yml up -d
```

All replicas must use the same `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`. Size `TOKENHUB_DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` per replica so the combined pool remains below the PostgreSQL connection limit. Never share a SQLite file between backend replicas.

Run the real two-instance PostgreSQL E2E suite with `./deploy/test-multi-instance.sh`.

### Kubernetes (Helm)

Kubernetes clusters use the Helm chart at `deploy/helm/tokenhub`. Every pod runs both processes in one container, pairs with a managed PostgreSQL service in production (a built-in subchart is available for quick testing), and is stateless by default: runtime-installed plugin packages are removed on pod replacement unless they are baked into the image. Optional PodMonitor and ExternalSecret support requires the matching operator CRDs. See [Kubernetes Deployment](kubernetes.md) for install steps, routing, and upgrade behavior.

## Native Release with systemd

Use the native Release installer for a single Linux host with systemd. Native packages support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, and bundle the Go backend, the standalone Next.js console, and a matching Node.js runtime.

Download and inspect the installer, then install the latest stable Release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astaxie/TokenHub/main/deploy/native/install.sh \
  -o /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh
sudo bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh install
```

When `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_HOST` is not set, the installer requests `https://ipinfo.io/json` and uses its validated IP response. If that lookup fails, it falls back to the first address from `hostname -I`, then `127.0.0.1`. The detected egress IP might not be the inbound address when the server is behind NAT, a proxy, or a load balancer, so set `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_HOST` when users open a different IP address or hostname. IPv6 literals are automatically bracketed when URLs are generated:

```bash
sudo env TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_HOST=tokenhub.example.com \
  bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh install
```

The resolved host is stored in `/etc/tokenhub/tokenhub.env` and reused by later installer runs, so upgrade output remains consistent even when automatic IP discovery changes.

To use PostgreSQL from the first start instead of the default SQLite database, pass its URL to the initial installation:

```bash
sudo env \
  TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@db.example.com:5432/tokenhub?sslmode=require' \
  bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh install
```

The installer writes this value to `/etc/tokenhub/tokenhub.env` only when creating the configuration. Later install, upgrade, and rollback runs preserve the existing file; edit it and restart TokenHub when intentionally changing databases.

The first installation generates production secrets and an initial admin password. The password is printed once. Runtime files are kept in separate locations:

- Releases and the `current` symlink: `/opt/tokenhub`
- Configuration and secrets: `/etc/tokenhub/tokenhub.env`
- SQLite database and backups: `/var/lib/tokenhub`
- Generated images: `/var/lib/tokenhub/images`
- Linux systemd unit: `/etc/systemd/system/tokenhub.service`

Edit `/etc/tokenhub/tokenhub.env` when changing public URLs, CORS origins, ports, database settings, or secrets, then restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tokenhub
sudo systemctl status tokenhub
sudo journalctl -u tokenhub -f
```

The installer verifies the Release archive against `checksums.txt` before activation and preserves configuration and data during upgrades:

```bash
sudo bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh upgrade
sudo bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh upgrade --version 0.3.3
sudo bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh rollback --version 0.3.2
sudo bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh uninstall
```

`upgrade` refuses a target older than the installed version; use the explicit `rollback` command for a downgrade. Upgrading an installation created by an older installer automatically adds `/var/lib/tokenhub/images` as persistent image storage unless `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_STORAGE_DIR` is already configured.

`uninstall` preserves `/etc/tokenhub` and `/var/lib/tokenhub`. Use `uninstall --purge` only when configuration and application data should also be deleted.
The installer records ownership markers in the application, configuration, and state directories. Uninstall refuses to recursively remove an unmarked or mismatched directory, and system-level paths such as `/opt`, `/etc`, and `/var/lib` are never accepted as managed directory targets. A fresh installation rejects equal backend and frontend ports. When `ss` or `lsof` is available, it also rejects occupied ports before downloading a Release. Install and upgrade report success only after the systemd unit is active and both the backend health endpoint and admin console respond; readiness failures include recent service logs.

For a fork, use its installer URL and tell TokenHub which public Release repository to query:

```bash
sudo env TOKENHUB_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=your-account/TokenHub \
  bash /tmp/tokenhub-install.sh install --version 0.3.3
```

Native Release installations are labeled `Native Release` in the version panel. Administrators can download and verify an update or rollback directly from the panel, then select **Restart now** to activate it through systemd. Each GitHub Release tag must be a strict `v`-prefixed semantic version and contain the Linux archive and `checksums.txt`; `.github/workflows/native-release.yml` builds and attaches the `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` assets when a Release is published.
Previously downloaded, validated releases remain available for rollback when the GitHub Releases API cannot be reached.

## Docker Compose

Create a deployment environment file:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Review `deploy/.env` before starting:

- `TOKENHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Optional static Admin API token. Set at least 32 random bytes when operational automation needs it; otherwise leave the placeholder to disable it.
- `TOKENHUB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Optional initial `admin` password. Set at least 12 bytes, or leave the placeholder so TokenHub generates one.
- `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`: Backend encryption root key. PostgreSQL and existing SQLite databases require at least 32 stable bytes. A brand-new file-backed SQLite deployment can leave the placeholder so TokenHub generates a `0600` key file beside the database.
- `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG`: Managed TokenHub image tag. Default: `latest`.
- `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Public backend URL shown to users.
- `TOKENHUB_API_BASE_URL`: Backend URL used by the browser admin console. The frontend server reads it at runtime. The deprecated `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` remains a fallback for one compatibility cycle.
- `TOKENHUB_BACKEND_PORT`: Host port for the backend. Default: `8080`.
- `TOKENHUB_FRONTEND_PORT`: Host port for the admin console. Default: `3000`.
- `TOKENHUB_BACKEND_REPLICAS`: Backend replica count for remote PostgreSQL Compose. Default: `2`.
- `TOKENHUB_FRONTEND_REPLICAS`: Frontend replica count for remote PostgreSQL Compose. Default: `2`.

The backend serves the public gateway API reference at `/docs` and the machine-readable OpenAPI 3.1 contract at `/openapi.json` and `/openapi.yaml`. The document server URL is derived from `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` when set, otherwise from the current request origin. Keep `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` aligned with the browser-facing backend origin when the service is behind a reverse proxy.

Browser clients, including the `/docs` **Try it out** flow, can call the gateway without extra CORS configuration only when the documentation page and backend gateway share the same origin. If the admin console or documentation is served from a different origin than `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, add that exact browser origin to `TOKENHUB_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Do not loosen production CORS with wildcards merely to make browser calls work.

Start the stack from the repository root:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh
```

The script validates the Compose environment, pulls the published image, and starts the managed application container without building locally. It waits up to 180 seconds for the Compose health check before reporting success. It also removes the obsolete standalone frontend container when upgrading from the former two-container layout; the `tokenhub-data` volume is preserved. If the image cannot be pulled during the initial GHCR rollout, it falls back to building from the local checkout. Validation errors name every unsafe variable without printing their values. If the new backend fails or does not become healthy, the script prints up to 100 log lines from that attempt.

The installer prefers the current `docker compose` CLI plugin and falls back to the legacy `docker-compose` command when only that command is available. It also supports Compose releases that provide `config --format` but not `config --environment`; this compatibility path requires `python3`.

Validate without pulling or starting containers:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh --check-only
```

Use a different environment file with `./deploy/install.sh --env-file /path/to/deploy.env`.

### Published image lifecycle

GitHub Actions publishes the complete `ghcr.io/astaxie/tokenhub-backend` image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Despite the compatibility-preserving image name, it contains the backend, standalone Next.js console, Node.js runtime, and the container supervisor.

- Publishing a GitHub Release with a strict `v`-prefixed semantic tag builds the exact numeric image tag. A non-prerelease also updates the major-minor tag and `latest`.
- `workflow_dispatch` can publish `edge` or an isolated `manual-*` tag. It cannot overwrite release or `latest` tags.
- Pull requests do not build or push container images.
- Merges to `main` do not publish images.

The image is first pushed under a run-specific staging tag and verified before the workflow promotes it to the requested release tags. For reproducible production deployments, pin an exact release tag instead of relying on `latest`.

The first GHCR publication creates a private package. The repository owner must make it public before anonymous deployments can pull it. Until then, a deployment using the default `latest` tag remains usable by automatically falling back to a local source build. If an explicit `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG` cannot be pulled, the installer exits instead of labeling current source as that version.

### Docker version status and rollback

Platform administrators can select the version badge below the TokenHub logo to inspect the running version, check the latest stable GitHub Release, and list up to three older stable releases. Release builds receive their exact version from the publication workflow; local source builds use the package version and are labeled as source builds. Managed update, rollback, and restart requests are recorded in the administrator audit log.

The check makes a time-limited outbound HTTPS request to the public GitHub Releases API and caches successful results for 20 minutes. It checks `astaxie/TokenHub` by default. Maintainers can set `TOKENHUB_RELEASE_REPOSITORY` to another trusted public `owner/repository` when validating releases from a fork. A GitHub outage or a repository without releases does not affect gateway traffic. The panel reports the unavailable state and keeps the current version visible.

For example, check a fork while running from source:

```bash
TOKENHUB_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=your-account/TokenHub ./start.sh
```

The default SQLite and local PostgreSQL Compose files run a single managed application container. An administrator can select **Update now**, wait for the checksummed platform Release bundle to be installed under the `tokenhub-releases` volume, and then select **Restart now**. The process exits after responding; Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` policy starts the selected backend and frontend together. The container never mounts the Docker socket or controls the host daemon.

The image version and content fingerprint form the baseline when a newly pulled image first uses the volume. Panel-applied updates survive ordinary restarts and container recreation with the same image because `current` and all installed Release bundles are stored in `tokenhub-releases`. Pulling a different image or rebuilding changed source under the same version activates the new image content. The remote PostgreSQL multi-instance Compose file disables in-place updates because changing only the replica that receives an admin request would split the cluster; its panel instructs operators to update manually with the original Compose file and environment configuration so configured replica counts are preserved. Source deployments continue to show manual guidance. Before rollback, create a database backup and confirm that the target release supports the current schema.

### Optional local build

Build from the current checkout instead of pulling published images:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh --build
```

The following acceleration settings apply only to local source builds.

The project Dockerfiles do not hard-code regional package mirrors. If your server has slow access to Docker Hub, npm, or Go module sources, configure acceleration on the deployment host instead of editing Dockerfiles.

For Docker base image pulls, configure Docker daemon registry mirrors on the server, for example in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, then restart Docker:

```json
{
	"registry-mirrors": [
		"https://<your-docker-registry-mirror>"
	]
}
```

For dependency downloads during image builds, prefer configuring an outbound HTTP/HTTPS proxy for Docker or BuildKit on the server. This keeps builds portable and avoids committing environment-specific npm or Go proxy settings to the repository.

If you deploy in an environment where direct access to upstream registries is slow, the following server-side examples can be used as references:

```bash
# Go module downloads
go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct

# npm package downloads
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

These commands configure the server or build environment. Do not add them directly to project Dockerfiles unless you intentionally maintain an environment-specific fork.

The compose file starts:

- Backend on `http://localhost:8080`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- SQLite data stored in the named Docker volume `tokenhub-data`
- Model catalog included in the selected backend image

Check status:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps
```

Initial admin login:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: the configured `TOKENHUB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or the generated value returned by:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml \
  exec tokenhub-backend /opt/tokenhub/current/bin/tokenhub initial-admin-password
```

The generated password is stored only as ciphertext and stops being retrievable after the first successful login or a password reset. Change it after signing in. In Kubernetes, use the same command through `kubectl exec <pod> -- ...`.

For `prod`, `production`, staging, and other non-development environments, known Admin Token and bootstrap-password placeholders are treated as unset. Other non-empty weak values are rejected. The encryption root key remains mandatory except for a brand-new file-backed SQLite database, where it is generated once and persisted beside the database. TokenHub never generates a replacement key for an existing database.

If startup cannot proceed safely, the process remains available on `/livez` but returns `503` from `/readyz`, `/healthz`, and application routes. This prevents an orchestrator liveness loop while keeping the Pod out of service. Correct the configuration and restart TokenHub; use `/livez` for liveness and `/readyz` for readiness probes.

View or follow logs manually:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml down
```

Stop and remove the SQLite data volume:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

Only use `down -v` when you intentionally want to delete local data.

## Running the Production Build Locally (without Docker)

`deploy/local/run-local.sh` runs the backend and the console on your own machine from a production build, with no Docker, no root and no systemd. This is a development aid, not a deployment method: to install TokenHub on a server, use [Native Release with systemd](#native-release-with-systemd) or [Docker Compose](#docker-compose).

```bash
./deploy/local/run-local.sh          # foreground, Ctrl-C stops both
./deploy/local/run-local.sh -d       # background, returns immediately
./deploy/local/run-local.sh status
./deploy/local/run-local.sh logs -f
./deploy/local/run-local.sh stop
```

Builds both components if needed, then runs them on loopback. The binary, the console bundle, the database, the logs and the pid files all live in `.tokenhub/` inside the repository, which is gitignored; deleting that directory resets the instance. Building may also refresh the usual ignored frontend artefacts (`frontend/node_modules`, `frontend/.next`). Nothing is installed system-wide and no service account is created.

This runs the **production** build — the same standalone bundle a deployment runs — rather than a dev server, so it surfaces problems that only appear in a production build. It uses development credentials (`admin` / `admin123456`), binds loopback only, and keeps its data in SQLite at `.tokenhub/tokenhub.db`.

With `-d` the services detach from the launching shell and keep running after it exits — and after the terminal closes — but not across a reboot; use a real installation for that. Both modes write pid files, so `status` and `stop` also work on a foreground instance. `stop` verifies that the recorded pid still belongs to this instance before signalling it, so a recycled pid is never killed by mistake, and both ports are claimed before anything starts so the script cannot report success against an unrelated service already listening.

Requires Go (the version in `backend/go.mod`), Node 22 or newer, npm and a C compiler, because the backend links SQLite through cgo.

Verified on Linux. macOS lacks `setsid`, so the script falls back to walking the process tree when stopping; that path is implemented but untested on macOS.

Options: `--rebuild`, `--reset` to drop the local database, `--backend-port N`, `--console-port N`, `restart`.

## Backend Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TOKENHUB_ENV` | `prod` | Runtime environment label |
| `TOKENHUB_HTTP_ADDR` | `:8080` | Backend listen address |
| `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public backend URL shown to users |
| `TOKENHUB_RELEASE_REPOSITORY` | `astaxie/TokenHub` | Trusted public GitHub repository used for version checks, in `owner/repository` form |
| `TOKENHUB_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` | build-time value | Overrides the deployment type compiled into the binary: `source`, `container` or `native`. The Compose files set `container` |
| `TOKENHUB_MANAGED_UPDATES` | `false` | Allows a container deployment to perform online update and rollback. A native deployment always allows it |
| `TOKENHUB_INSTALL_ROOT` | `/opt/tokenhub` | Managed Release installation root used for online update and rollback |
| `TOKENHUB_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | empty | Comma-separated proxy IPs or CIDRs allowed to supply `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto`. Trusted proxies must overwrite these headers rather than pass through client values |
| `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ACCESS_MODE` | `strict` | `strict` permits RFC1918/ULA literals when the CIDR list is empty. Loopback still requires `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK`. Set `auto` to allow administrator-configured private DNS names. Unknown values use strict behavior |
| `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_PROXY_LOCAL` | `false` | Local upstreams bypass the selected proxy by default. Set `true` to apply the selected proxy policy to local targets too; inherited environment mode still honors `NO_PROXY`. Select Use Global Proxy together with `true` to force local traffic through that proxy |
| `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOWED_CIDRS` | empty | Optional restrictive private CIDR list. An empty list allows RFC1918/ULA literals in both modes. In auto mode those ranges also apply to private DNS results. A nonempty list restricts private literals, and in auto mode also restricts private DNS results. Invalid nonempty entries do not enable unrestricted access. Special-use addresses cannot be allowlisted |
| `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_NAT64_PREFIX` | empty | Optional RFC 6052 DNS64/NAT64 prefix used to classify its embedded IPv4 targets. Supported prefix lengths: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 96. Configure this when using a network-specific prefix such as `64:ff9b:1::/48`; the well-known `64:ff9b::/96` prefix works automatically |
| `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK` | `false` | Effective in strict mode or with a nonempty private allowlist. There, `true` permits localhost/127.0.0.1/::1. Auto mode without a private allowlist allows loopback regardless of this value |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` | empty | Standard outbound forward proxy used by every HTTP Provider channel. Proxy selection is operator-managed; direct requests continue to use TokenHub's DNS/IP egress checks |
| `NO_PROXY` | empty | Standard comma-separated proxy bypass list. Matching Provider requests use the guarded direct path |
| `TOKENHUB_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | public URL | Comma-separated exact browser origins allowed to call the backend; when set, the same origins are the exact allowlist for OAuth console returns. Each entry must contain only the scheme, host, and optional port, with no path |
| `TOKENHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN` | `change-me-tokenhub-admin-token` | Optional static Admin API token; the known placeholder disables it |
| `TOKENHUB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `change-me-tokenhub-admin-password` | Optional initial `admin` password; the known placeholder generates a random first-run password |
| `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY` | `change-me-tokenhub-secret-key` | Stable encryption root key; generated beside a new file-backed SQLite database only |
| `TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///app/data/tokenhub.db` | Database connection URL (sqlite:// or postgresql://) |
| `TOKENHUB_DB_HOST` | empty | PostgreSQL host. Setting it builds the DSN from the `TOKENHUB_DB_*` fields instead of `TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL`, which avoids URL encoding when the password contains `#`, `?`, `/` or `%`. `TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL` still takes precedence when both are set |
| `TOKENHUB_DB_PORT` | `5432` | PostgreSQL port; used only when `TOKENHUB_DB_HOST` is set |
| `TOKENHUB_DB_USER` | empty | PostgreSQL user; used only when `TOKENHUB_DB_HOST` is set |
| `TOKENHUB_DB_PASSWORD` | empty | PostgreSQL password; used only when `TOKENHUB_DB_HOST` is set |
| `TOKENHUB_DB_NAME` | empty | PostgreSQL database name; used only when `TOKENHUB_DB_HOST` is set |
| `TOKENHUB_DB_SSLMODE` | `disable` | PostgreSQL sslmode; used only when `TOKENHUB_DB_HOST` is set |
| `TOKENHUB_SQLITE_BACKUP_DIR` | `/app/data/backups` | Backup output directory |
| `TOKENHUB_MODEL_CATALOG_FILE` | `/opt/tokenhub/current/catalog/model-catalog.yaml` | Standard model catalog file in managed deployments |
| `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_CATALOG_FILE` | `/opt/tokenhub/current/catalog/provider-catalog.json` | Provider templates and candidate-model catalog file in managed deployments |
| `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_DIR` | `/app/plugins` | Persistent plugin package directory scanned at startup and reloaded after plugin lifecycle operations; multi-instance deployments must coordinate the same package version across replicas |
| `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE_URL` | empty | HTTPS plugin-marketplace index URL used by the admin console to browse plugin listings; online indexes are discovery-only until verified |
| `TOKENHUB_SEED_DEMO` | `false` | Whether to seed demo data |
| `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Provider resource failure threshold before cooldown |
| `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `300` | Base cooldown before a parked provider resource is given a half-open retry |
| `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_COOLDOWN_MAX_SECONDS` | `3600` | Upper bound for the exponential backoff applied to repeated recovery failures |
| `TOKENHUB_METRICS_ENABLED` | `false` | Collect Prometheus metrics and serve `GET /metrics` |
| `TOKENHUB_METRICS_TOKEN` | empty | Bearer token for `/metrics`; falls back to the admin token when empty |
| `TOKENHUB_METRICS_PROJECT_LABEL` | `false` | Add `project_id` to gateway metrics; raises series count by the project count |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_ENABLED` | `false` | Export one OpenTelemetry trace per gateway call over OTLP/HTTP |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_ENDPOINT` | empty | Signal-specific OTLP traces URL, used verbatim; for Langfuse `<host>/api/public/otel/v1/traces` |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_HEADERS` | empty | Comma-separated `name=value` export headers; holds a credential |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_CAPTURE_PAYLOADS` | `false` | Include prompts, responses and upstream error text in exported spans |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_SAMPLE_RATIO` | `1` | Fraction of calls exported, from 0 to 1 |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `10` | Time limit for one export attempt |
| `TOKENHUB_TRACING_QUEUE_SIZE` | `2048` | Completions waiting to become spans; a full queue drops traces instead of slowing requests |
| `TOKENHUB_UPSTREAM_NON_STREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120` | Total time limit for one non-streaming upstream request |
| `TOKENHUB_UPSTREAM_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | Streaming calls have no total limit; this bounds waiting for response headers and how long the stream may then stay silent. The budget restarts on every byte received |
| `TOKENHUB_MAX_JSON_REQUEST_BYTES` | `8388608` (8 MiB) | Maximum JSON request body for `/v1` endpoints. Accepts a raw byte count or a binary suffix (`8m`, `8mib`, `512k`). Values above 512 MiB are clamped |
| `TOKENHUB_MAX_MULTIMODAL_REQUEST_BYTES` | `33554432` (32 MiB) | Higher body limit for multimodal chat endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/messages`, playground). Set your reverse proxy's `client_max_body_size` at least this large |
| `TOKENHUB_NGINX_CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE` | `32m` | Only the bundled multi-instance nginx load balancer reads this. It is nginx size syntax (`32m`, `512k`), not the backend byte format, and must be at least as large as `TOKENHUB_MAX_MULTIMODAL_REQUEST_BYTES` |
| `TOKENHUB_IN_FLIGHT_LEASE_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | Expiry and renewal basis for cluster-wide concurrency leases |
| `TOKENHUB_CLUSTER_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` | `180` | Expiry and renewal basis for cluster coordination locks |
| `TOKENHUB_BILLING_REDIS_URL` | empty | Optional Redis URL for high-concurrency billing admission. When set, Redis handles minute RPM/TPM reservations and API Key/user concurrency leases; the database remains the durable billing ledger |
| `TOKENHUB_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_SECONDS` | `150` | Maximum time to drain in-flight requests during shutdown |
| `TOKENHUB_STOP_GRACE_PERIOD` | `180s` | Compose grace period before Docker force-stops the backend |
| `TOKENHUB_CACHE_AFFINITY_ENABLED` | `false` | For Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and Responses, pin a session to one upstream account so the provider's prompt cache keeps hitting. Off by default because it changes routing behaviour |

To run the optional Redis billing component with Compose, add the overlay file to the normal command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.yml \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```

### Local and private model services

Administrators can enter HTTP private-literal endpoints such as `http://192.168.1.10:8000/v1` without changing the access mode. Set `auto` to also allow loopback and private DNS names such as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`, `host.docker.internal`, a Docker service name, or an enterprise DNS name, without configuring a CIDR allowlist. The address must be reachable from the backend. A container's loopback address refers to that container, not its host. TokenHub does not create DNS entries, Docker network attachments, or host aliases.

Saving validates URL syntax and literal addresses without DNS queries, so offline services can be configured without blocking storage operations. Before sending a request, HTTP hostnames must resolve entirely to permitted local addresses. Public or mixed public/private HTTP results are rejected before any credentials or body are sent. Direct connections use the validated addresses without a second lookup; proxy requests keep the original Host and TLS server name. Metadata, link-local, multicast and other protected special-use targets remain denied. Redirects may keep the same scheme and authority, including a local same-origin redirect; cross-origin redirects remain denied.

When proxying an HTTP hostname, TokenHub uses CONNECT to a validated IP and preserves the original Host inside the tunnel. The proxy must permit CONNECT to the model service port; a rejection does not fall back to direct access.

Strict mode is the default. It allows RFC1918/ULA literals and still requires `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK` for localhost. Operators must set `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ACCESS_MODE=auto` to permit private DNS names. Nonempty private allowlists remain restrictive in either mode, including when denying all private literals. Set `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_PROXY_LOCAL=true` separately when local traffic must follow the selected proxy. These deployment settings require a backend restart or container recreation.

Provider egress can also be changed without restarting under **System Settings → Base Settings → Provider Egress Mode**. `Inherit Environment Proxy` (the upgrade default) reads `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` captured at process startup; `Direct Connection` bypasses them; `Use Global Proxy` applies one HTTP or HTTPS forward proxy to every Provider upstream channel, including inference, streaming, images, model discovery, provider catalog refresh, quota calls, and Provider credential refresh. Identity login, notifications, tracing, and version updates are not routed through this setting.

The configured proxy supports optional Basic authentication. Its password is encrypted at rest and masked in APIs and the console. Saving the proxy validates its syntax only; **Test Proxy Connection** uses the current unsaved form and an existing Provider to verify proxy TCP/TLS, authentication, CONNECT, and target TLS with system CAs, without sending Provider credentials or a model request. Provider and Provider Resource base URLs retain their existing save-time scheme and literal-address validation in every proxy mode: metadata and other always-denied targets remain rejected, while local targets follow the auto/strict access policy described above. Before every proxied request, TokenHub resolves the original Provider hostname locally, applies the configured local-address and special-use policy, and pins the proxy request or CONNECT tunnel to the validated IP while preserving the original HTTP Host and TLS server name. Direct and `NO_PROXY` requests apply the same address policy in their guarded dial path. Proxy configuration, authentication, connection, timeout, and HTTPS CONNECT failures are treated as platform egress failures: they do not penalize a Provider resource or trigger route failover. For plaintext HTTP proxy requests, an HTTP error response may come from either the proxy or the Provider and retains normal upstream error handling. Replicas reload shared settings within five seconds and keep the last valid setting across temporary database read failures.

When the backend uses Fake-IP DNS, configure the actual pool under **System Settings → Base Settings → Synthetic DNS / Fake-IP Ranges**. This independent exception applies only to DNS results, not literal Provider IPs, and remains disabled by default. Do not assume every proxy uses `198.18.0.0/15`: that range is reserved for benchmarking and is not Fake-IP-specific. Private synthetic pools require the separate explicit private-range trust setting. A hostname matching an enabled synthetic pool continues to require HTTPS and does not receive the automatic local proxy bypass, even when its synthetic IP falls inside RFC1918/ULA. Real local services follow the auto/strict policy above independently. Synthetic exceptions cannot authorize loopback, link-local, metadata, multicast or protected NAT64 targets.

Model catalog connection failures now distinguish blocked DNS addresses (`provider_models_address_blocked`), DNS lookup failures (`provider_models_dns_failed`), timeouts (`provider_models_timeout`), and TLS certificate verification failures (`provider_models_tls_failed`). For a blocked Fake-IP result, verify the actual proxy address pool before configuring the existing exception. Error responses use fixed messages and never expose raw transport errors or credentials. Blocked-address errors include normalized rejected IPs in `error.details.blocked_ips`; playground failure events include them in `error_details.blocked_ips`. The console displays those addresses alongside the settings path. Verify the proxy pool before configuring it; the application does not automatically trust rejected addresses.

## Frontend Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TOKENHUB_API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Backend Admin API URL read by the frontend server at runtime |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | empty | Deprecated compatibility fallback; migrate to `TOKENHUB_API_BASE_URL` |

## Data and Backups

SQLite is the persistent source for projects, keys, Providers, routes, users, request logs, usage, alerts, approvals, sessions, and backup records.

In the one-command compose deployment:

- Database path inside the backend container: `/app/data/tokenhub.db`
- Backup path inside the backend container: `/app/data/backups`
- Docker volume name: `tokenhub-data`

Recommended production setup:

- Store the SQLite database on a persistent disk.
- Store backups outside the application container.
- Rotate old backups according to your retention policy.
- Keep provider credentials and admin tokens in a secret manager or protected environment variables.

## Catalog Files

Published managed images and native archives include matching copies of `data/model-catalog.yaml` and `data/provider-catalog.json`. They are activated with the rest of the release under `/opt/tokenhub/current/catalog/`, so the backend binary and both catalogs always come from the same version. Backend startup reads the vendored Provider catalog locally and does not depend on network access. An explicit administrator Provider-catalog refresh fetches the complete `PublicProviderConf` catalog from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/PublicProviderConf/dev/dist/all.json`; a failed or incomplete response falls back to the configured local `provider-catalog.json`.

To mount a custom catalog explicitly:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh --model-catalog /absolute/path/to/model-catalog.yaml
```

After editing the configured catalog file, restart the backend or choose **Settings → Base Settings → Sync Model Reference Catalog**. Either path synchronizes the reference metadata without removing custom external models and does not publish any model.

The custom mount intentionally overrides the image catalog and is therefore managed separately from `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG`. After updating that file, restart the backend container or run the settings synchronization action, and confirm that the operation completes without a model-catalog error.

`data/model-catalog.yaml` provides tracked reference metadata; it is not a route allowlist and does not publish models. `data/provider-catalog.json` provides Provider templates and the upstream models that can be selected during Provider setup. Importing a selection creates persisted Provider-model inventory only. External models and their unified client-facing prices are created separately in Model Directory, then mapped to imported Provider models under Routing Policies. `GET /v1/models` lists only active external models with at least one active route, filtered by the API Key model allowlist when configured. `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_DIR` points at the persistent plugin package directory scanned during backend startup. In Docker Compose deployments the directory is backed by the `tokenhub-plugins` volume, so package state survives image upgrades. The container entrypoint validates `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_DIR` as an absolute non-root path and creates it with ownership for the runtime `node` user before dropping root privileges, including on fresh volumes. `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE_URL` can point at a HTTPS JSON index of plugin descriptors so the admin console can browse listings; online indexes are discovery-only until their detached signature and revocation feed are verified, while offline mirrors can be used as installation sources. To use a custom Provider catalog for startup and refresh fallback, set `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_CATALOG_FILE` to a local JSON file using the same `providers` structure.

### Connecting to Kronk

TokenHub connects to an external Kronk Model Server; it does not install Kronk, download GGUF files, or embed llama.cpp. `127.0.0.1` inside the TokenHub container points to that container, not the Docker host. When Kronk runs on the host, use a host-reachable private IP or `host.docker.internal` where supported; when it runs in another container, use a shared Docker network and the Kronk service name. Literal private IPs work in the default strict mode. DNS names such as `host.docker.internal` require `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ACCESS_MODE=auto`. Use loopback only when TokenHub and Kronk share the same network namespace; strict mode requires `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK`.

Kronk listens on plaintext HTTP by default. For remote deployment, use a trusted private network or a TLS reverse proxy and enable an appropriate Kronk authorization mode. TokenHub accesses only inference, model discovery, liveness, and readiness endpoints; it does not proxy model download, directory, security administration, debug, pprof, or management UI endpoints.

## Reverse Proxy

For production, place TokenHub behind HTTPS and forward:

- Admin console traffic to the frontend service.
- `/api/*`, `/v1/*`, `/v1beta/*`, `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, `/openapi.yaml`, `/livez`, `/readyz`, and `/healthz` traffic to the backend service.

Set request body and streaming timeouts high enough for long model responses.

Use `/livez` for liveness and `/readyz` for readiness. `/readyz` and the backwards-compatible `/healthz` return `503` when the database is unavailable or the database evolution state is not servable: a dirty or unverifiable migration ledger, or an incomplete blocking data backfill. Pending online data backfills do not affect readiness.
