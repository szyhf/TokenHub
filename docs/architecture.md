# TokenHub Architecture

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/architecture.md) | [日本語](ja/architecture.md)

This document describes the architecture implemented in this repository for developers, operators, and security teams. TokenHub defaults to a single-instance SQLite deployment and also supports single-instance PostgreSQL and multi-instance deployments backed by remote PostgreSQL.

## Overview

The Go backend hosts the Admin API, OpenAI-compatible model API, routing, provider adapters, audit, and persistence in one process. The Next.js application is the admin console. Control plane and data plane are logical boundaries: they share one backend and database by default, while multi-instance deployments share state through PostgreSQL.

The backend is organized as Core, built-in plugins, and installable external packages. Core retains public API compatibility, authentication, authorization, routing admission, persistence, metering, and audit. Built-in plugins provide executable Provider, gateway, job, and action capabilities in process. External packages currently provide validated metadata and declarative presentation only; their executable entry points are not launched.

## Planes

| Plane | Entry points and users | Responsibilities | Current implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control plane | Admin console and `/api/admin/*` | Providers, resources, models, routes, projects, users, keys, quotas, alerts, approvals, and backups | Next.js console and Go Admin API; state is stored in SQLite or PostgreSQL |
| Data plane | Applications and `/v1/*` | Validate project API keys, select routes, call upstream models, return compatible responses | Go `net/http`; Chat Completions, Responses, streaming Responses, `/v1/responses/compact`, and Embeddings |
| Operations plane | Probes, Admin API, deployment tooling | Request audit, usage, route attempts, provider probes, backups, and cluster coordination | Runs in the backend process; PostgreSQL persists coordination state for multi-instance deployments |

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Compose file | Services and ingress | Database and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default single instance | `deploy/docker-compose.yml` | One frontend and one backend; publishes `3000` and `8080` directly | SQLite for development, testing, and single-host private deployments |
| PostgreSQL single instance | `deploy/docker-compose.postgres.yml` | One frontend, one backend, and local PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL for production workloads that need higher concurrency or database governance |
| Remote PostgreSQL multi-instance | `deploy/docker-compose.remote-postgres.yml` | Nginx plus scalable frontend and backend replicas | Managed PostgreSQL for high availability and horizontal scaling |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    users["Browsers and applications"] --> nginx["Nginx load balancer\nremote PostgreSQL multi-instance mode"]
    nginx --> frontends["Next.js replicas x N"]
    nginx --> backends["Go backend replicas x N"]
    frontends --> backends
    backends --> database[("Remote PostgreSQL")]
    catalog["Catalog bundled in image\nor custom read-only mount"] --> backends
    backends --> providers["External Provider APIs"]
```

The default Compose file has no reverse proxy and exposes frontend and backend ports directly. A production deployment may place HTTPS termination in front of it. The remote PostgreSQL Compose deployment includes Nginx and routes `/api/*`, `/v1/*`, `/livez`, `/readyz`, and `/healthz` to backend replicas.

The default image uses the model catalog bundled at build time so the executable and catalog share a version. A custom catalog is an explicit override through `./deploy/install.sh --model-catalog /absolute/path/to/model-catalog.yaml`; it is not a default Compose mount.

## Plugin Runtime and Boundaries

`backend/internal/server/plugin_bootstrap.go` assembles the plugin registry, gateway chain and runner, admin UI registry, action broker, background-job broker/runner, and adapter registry. It registers built-in contributions, inspects packages from `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_DIR`, and publishes supported declarative contributions. Built-in and external packages share metadata and capability contracts, but only built-ins execute inside the Go process. `stdio-json-v1` defines a Devkit and future runtime contract; it is not an operational external execution path in the current release.

| Surface | Implementation entry points | Responsibility and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package contract and loading | `backend/internal/plugin/manifest.go`, `runtime.go`, `registry.go` | Validate manifest schema, Plugin API compatibility, permissions, and package state before registration |
| Provider | `backend/internal/server/provider_plugin_adapter.go`, `adapter_registry.go` | Built-in adapters invoke declared operations using provider/resource/credential projections; Core retains routing and accounting |
| Gateway chain | `backend/internal/plugin/gateway_chain.go`, `gateway_runner.go`; `backend/internal/server/gateway_plugin_hooks.go` | Run in-process stage-specific hooks with permitted data, validate structured results, and enforce stage mutation rules |
| Background jobs and actions | `backend/internal/plugin/background_scheduler.go`, `background_job.go`, `action_broker.go` | Schedule in-process jobs and broker operator actions; these are separate from durable background Responses jobs |
| Presentation | `backend/internal/plugin/admin_ui.go`, `sim.go` | Declarative panels, settings, themes, and layouts rendered by the console; no arbitrary plugin React or JavaScript execution |

Packages declare `plugin.yaml` with manifest schema `2` and Plugin API `v2`; schema `1` and API `v1` remain supported through the compatibility adapter. Permissions constrain which Core data would be projected into an invocation and which structured changes Core would accept. This is not an operating-system sandbox: the command policy currently reports network and resource enforcement as `unsupported`. TokenHub therefore fails closed and rejects every runtime-loaded external action, background job, Provider command, and gateway command before launch until process, network, and resource isolation can be enforced by the host. An enabled package with an executable backend entry is persisted as `failed_startup`, remains installed and inspectable, and publishes none of its runtime capabilities. Purely declarative presentation packages and in-process built-ins are unaffected. The generic command limits remain part of the future execution contract: 30 seconds, 4 MiB input, and 1 MiB output by default, with surface-specific limits such as the 5-second default gateway-hook timeout. External Provider streaming is likewise unavailable while external commands are disabled; its current protocol shape describes an event array rather than a live child-process stream.

All three Compose variants mount `tokenhub-plugins` at `/app/plugins` and expose `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_DIR` and `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE_URL`. Package files and lifecycle state live on the filesystem, while registries and runners are process-local. Plugin lifecycle operations reload the runtime in the server that handles the request, so package validation, declarative contribution changes, and lifecycle failure reporting do not require a service restart. Reloading evaluates external command packages but does not make them executable. PostgreSQL does not distribute plugin binaries or refresh every replica's registry; multi-instance deployments must coordinate package versions and reload each replica.

Installation and marketplace code provide checksum verification, signed-marketplace trust checks, permission review, failed-package quarantine, and rollback paths. These controls do not establish atomic fleet-wide activation or isolation from host resources. See the [Plugin Development Guide](plugin-development/README.md) for the detailed contract and lifecycle procedures.

## Components and Providers

| Component | Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin console | `frontend/` | Role-aware console; reads its backend address at runtime from `TOKENHUB_API_BASE_URL`, with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` retained only as a compatibility fallback |
| HTTP server | `backend/internal/server/http.go` | APIs, authentication, routed calls, responses, and health endpoints |
| Routing | `backend/internal/server/http.go` | Candidate ordering by priority, resource priority, strategy, weight, and affinity |
| Adapter registry and integration service | `adapter_registry.go`, `integration_service.go` | Declares provider capabilities and runs provider/resource probes |
| Provider adapters | `builtin_provider_plugins.go`, `provider_plugin_adapter.go`, `provider_account_codex.go` | Protocol translation; Codex subscription OAuth, refresh, and session affinity |
| Store | `store.go` | GORM access, quotas, credential encryption, SQLite backups, PostgreSQL leases, and cluster locks |

The following are the operational built-in Provider registrations. Effective capabilities come from the enabled built-in plugin and adapter descriptors, Provider policy, and model/resource support. External manifests may describe additional Provider types for package inspection and Devkit contract testing, but current TokenHub releases do not activate their command-backed adapters.

| Provider type | Adapter and capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| `openai` | Chat, streaming Chat, Responses, streaming Responses, Embeddings, probes, and image generation |
| `openai_compatible`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, `local` | OpenAI-compatible operations; model and provider policy can narrow Responses support |
| `kronk` | Chat, streaming Chat, Responses, streaming Responses, Embeddings, model discovery, and probes |
| `azure_openai` | Chat, streaming Chat, Embeddings, and probes |
| `anthropic` | Chat, streaming Chat, and probes |
| `gemini` | Chat, streaming Chat, Embeddings, and probes |
| `openai_codex` | Responses, streaming Responses, models, probes, quota, OAuth, session affinity, Compact, and image generation |
| `mock` | Local verification and tests |

The Provider inventory supports team ownership: a Provider row may carry an `owner_team_id`, in which case only platform administrators and the owning team's leaders can manage that channel and its resources. Provider management handlers enforce this at every write path. Routing inherits the same tenancy: a route may only reference a provider its creator may manage, and the candidate filter in the route planner serves a team-owned provider exclusively to projects whose primary team matches, so one external model name can safely map to both a platform channel and several teams' channels.

## Model Request Flow

This sequence summarizes the Core request flow. At the applicable stages, the gateway runner projects permitted data to registered hooks and validates their results before Core continues. Hook stages cover privacy/guardrail processing, context and cache operations, candidate selection/ranking, request/response transforms, usage, settlement, and trace export. A declared stage does not mean every endpoint or installed plugin implements that capability; endpoint support and stage rules still apply.

`Model` is the external API contract, `ProviderModel` is a persisted upstream inventory item for one Provider, and `ModelRoute` maps between them. External models carry an explicit persisted directory role, so removing their last route leaves them as drafts instead of turning them back into candidate templates. Route creation and editing require the selected `ProviderModel` to exist in inventory. The narrow exception is the subscription-backed virtual model `codex-gpt-image-2`: its route must target an OpenAI Codex Provider and the fixed upstream model `gpt-image-2`, which is an execution capability rather than a chat-model inventory item. This allows a same-name 1:1 mapping or a custom alias without exposing provider-specific model names to callers. `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/responses`, `POST /v1/responses/compact`, and `POST /v1/embeddings` share the same authentication, quota, and routing entry point.

```

Inactive or unhealthy providers, resources, and routes are skipped, with one exception: a resource whose cooldown has lapsed is readmitted as a half-open candidate. The first request that reaches it claims the trial by pushing its cooldown deadline forward, so concurrent requests are still rejected and a failed trial has already armed the next, longer window. Only that trial's own success closes the breaker and restores the resource without admin action — a request that was already in flight when the breaker tripped cannot resurrect it. Repeated failures widen the window exponentially up to `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_COOLDOWN_MAX_SECONDS`. A resource an administrator disabled is never readmitted. Non-streaming calls try candidates in order. A stream cannot safely switch upstream after output has started; streaming Responses require an adapter with the `responses_stream` capability. `openai_codex` routes can derive a session affinity key from the request and API key, then persist a resource binding for continuity.

For `POST /v1/responses` with `background: true`, the synchronous request flow stops after authentication and durable submission. Every replica polls the durable queue even when it was empty at startup. A worker claims the job, revalidates its original authorization, and commits the admitted phase, request ID, quota counters, token reservation, and concurrency lease in one database transaction before entering the same guardrail, routing, provider, metering, audit, and tracing flow. A lease epoch fences stale workers. PostgreSQL uses row locks with `SKIP LOCKED` across replicas; SQLite uses an atomic claim in the supported single-backend deployment. Pre-admission lease loss is replayable, while post-admission lease loss is terminal rather than risking a duplicate provider request; an undispatched token reservation is refunded during recovery.

Project and API-key model access is an explicit least-privilege layer before route selection: restricted lists are intersected and restricted-empty denies all, while legacy blank modes remain inherited. Scoped routing policies are stored as audited `AdminResource` records of kind `routing-policies`. The runtime selects at most one binding with strict API Key → Project → Global precedence, then intersects its Provider, resource, model, tag, region, and environment constraints with route project scope. A higher-priority binding that is disabled, conflicting, or empty fails closed. Strategy overrides, affinity, half-open recovery, and failover operate only on the filtered candidates. The effective policy ID, scope, and priority are copied into request audit records.

## Security, Health, and Data Boundaries

- Project API keys are validated for hash, status, project state, expiration, model scope, IP allowlist, quota, and concurrency.
- Admin calls use a login session token or an optional `TOKENHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN`. The initial `admin` account uses `TOKENHUB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` when configured; otherwise TokenHub generates a password whose encrypted retrievable copy is deleted after first login or reset.
- Non-development startup disables known placeholders for optional bootstrap credentials and rejects other weak non-empty values. `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY` stays mandatory, except that a brand-new file-backed SQLite database receives a persistent key file beside the database. Existing databases never receive a replacement key automatically.
- `TOKENHUB_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` defines which proxies may supply `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto`; trusted proxies must overwrite those headers. `TOKENHUB_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` controls credentialed browser origins.
- `/livez` is a process liveness probe. `/readyz` and compatibility `/healthz` check database availability and the database evolution state: they return `503` when the database is unavailable, a migration is dirty or the ledger fails verification, or a blocking data backfill is incomplete. Pending online backfills keep the instance ready. Unsafe startup configuration also keeps only `/livez` healthy while all readiness and application routes return `503` until configuration is corrected and the process restarts.

Provider credentials, billing connector credentials, raw billing snapshots, and persistent background Responses payloads are AES-GCM encrypted from `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`; project API keys retain only a SHA-256 digest plus display prefix and suffix. Every replica must use the same stable secret.

| Category | Key entities | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tenancy and credentials | `Project`, `APIKey`, `AdminUser`, `AdminSession` | Project ownership, application access, and admin sessions |
| Routing | `Provider`, `ProviderResource`, `ProviderModel`, `Model`, `ModelRoute`, `AdminResource (routing-policies)` | Upstream channels, resource pools, upstream inventory, external models, routes, and scoped policy bindings |
| Content security | `guardrails.Policy`, `guardrails.DetectionItem`, `guardrails.Binding` | Project-scoped request inspection, detector configuration, actions, and policy bindings |
| Governance and metering | `QuotaBucket`, `UsageRecord`, `ProviderResourceBucket`, `InFlightLease` | Quotas, usage/cost, and cross-replica concurrency |
| External billing | `BillingConnector`, `BillingRecord`, `BillingRawSnapshot`, `BillingSyncRun` | Provider billing collection, normalization, checkpoints, and sync history |
| Multi-instance coordination | `ClusterLease`, `ClusterTaskState`, `AdapterSessionBinding` | Catalog sync, cluster operations, and Codex session resource bindings |
| Background Responses | `ResponseJob`, `ResponseJobEvent` | Encrypted request/result retention, fenced execution state, cancellation, expiry, and transition audit |
| Observability | `RequestLog`, `RequestPayloadLog`, `RouteAttemptLog`, `ProviderObservation`, `AuditEvent` | Request traceability, payload audit, route attempts, provider observations, and admin audit |

SQLite uses one connection with a five-second `busy_timeout` and must not be shared by backend replicas. PostgreSQL provides pooling, migration advisory locks, in-flight leases, and cluster locks. The built-in backup API is SQLite-only; PostgreSQL should use platform backup tooling such as `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

The deployment has no Redis, message broker, or service mesh dependency. Synchronous request and response payloads may be recorded for audit, so production deployments should apply retention, least privilege, disk encryption, and backup access controls. Persistent background Responses are excluded from plaintext payload audit and trace export; their content remains only in the encrypted, TTL-bound job record.
