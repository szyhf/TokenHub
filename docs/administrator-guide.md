# Administrator Guide

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/administrator-guide.md) | [日本語](ja/administrator-guide.md)

This guide is for platform administrators, security operators, and infrastructure owners who run TokenHub as an enterprise AI gateway.

## Administrator Scope

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Provider Channels | Configure upstream connections, import model inventory, and maintain actual Provider costs |
| Model Directory | Choose from the built-in model catalog, create external API models, select initial Provider routes, and set unified client-facing prices |
| Routing Policies | Fine-tune Provider mappings, priority, weight, project scope, and failover strategy |
| Projects and Teams | Define ownership boundaries for keys, quota, and cost attribution |
| Identity Sources | Configure OAuth or OIDC login providers for enterprise sign-in |
| Plugin Management | Install and inspect external packages, manage lifecycle state, and operate supported built-in or declarative capabilities |
| Security and Audit | Review request logs, admin events, key rotation, and policy changes |

## Production Setup Order

1. Configure at least one identity source and keep a controlled administrator account.
2. Add an upstream Provider such as `OpenAI Production`, `Azure East US`, or `Internal Model Gateway`. Before saving, use **Test Connection** to validate its Base URL and API Key and review the measured response latency, then import the upstream models that it can serve.
3. Record each imported Provider model's actual input, cache-read, and output costs for audit.
4. Create the external models to expose to applications and set their unified client-facing prices.
5. Add routes from each external model to one or more imported Provider models.
6. Create teams, projects, cost centers, and default quota policies.
7. Validate the flow with Model Playground and request logs.
8. Review usage attribution before issuing keys broadly.

Anthropic Providers use `x-api-key` authentication by default. If an Anthropic-compatible upstream requires `Authorization: Bearer`, open the Provider's **Advanced** tab, keep **Provider Type** set to **Claude / Anthropic**, and select **Authorization Bearer** under **Anthropic Authentication**. TokenHub derives either header from the encrypted Provider API Key and sends only the selected authentication header; do not duplicate the credential in custom headers.

## Plugin Management

Open **Plugin Management** to browse the unified list of built-in and installed plugins by Provider Integration, Request Pipeline, UI Template, or Automation. Each detail page explains the plugin's purpose and exposes package files; settings appear only for implemented declarative settings surfaces. Marketplace and local package installs are validated by checksum, written to `TOKENHUB_PLUGIN_DIR`, and evaluated by a runtime reload. Declarative presentation packages can become active. An enabled external package with a backend command is instead shown as **Startup Failed**, remains installed and inspectable, and does not register its Provider, hook, job, or action because external execution is unavailable in this release. Built-ins can be enabled or disabled but not uninstalled; external packages can also be updated or uninstalled.

Provider plugins can declare routing and credential policy in their manifest. Set `capabilities.provider.credentials_scope: resource` for subscription/account-style Providers whose upstream secrets must live on Provider Resources rather than the Provider itself. Set `capabilities.provider.route_requires_resource: true` when every route attempt must select an eligible Provider Resource; Core persists these policies on created Providers and applies the same missing, disabled, unhealthy, cooldown, and resource-group checks that built-in subscription Providers use. Set `capabilities.provider.reasoning_configurable` to show or hide the Admin reasoning-parameter controls explicitly; older plugins without that field still fall back to route-protocol inference.

Provider plugins that accept Responses-shaped requests behind a compatibility bridge can list `codex/responses` in `capabilities.provider.route_protocols`. Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages routes then use the shared Chat/Anthropic-to-Responses bridge for that Provider instead of relying on a built-in Provider type.

Plugins that support request session affinity can also declare `session_affinity` in `capabilities.gateway` and set `capabilities.provider.session_affinity_kind` to `provider_session` or `codex_session`. Core uses that policy when Responses, Chat, Anthropic, Gemini, or Responses Compact routes derive sticky Provider Resource bindings from session headers or request metadata.

Registered in-process background jobs can be run manually from the background job manifest table. Manual runs use the same Core runner as scheduled jobs, including input schema validation, retry settings, timeout handling, concurrency limits, last-run tracking, result sanitization, and admin audit events. TokenHub redacts secret-looking fields such as access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, passwords, cookies, and private keys before returning run results to the console. External command jobs are not registered while external execution is unavailable.

## Model Playground Diagnostics

Open **Model Playground** from the console to validate a model through the same routing and Provider adapters used by gateway traffic. Every assistant turn keeps its own compact diagnostic summary: delivery mode, gateway-measured time to first token (TTFT), output throughput, total duration, full-context input tokens, output tokens, estimated cost, local completion time, and request ID. Expand **Diagnostics** to inspect millisecond timestamps plus the actual response details. Sessions remain in the current browser page unless explicitly exported.

TokenHub streams a unified SSE event format to the Playground. If the selected upstream supports streaming, TTFT is measured from gateway admission to the first content delta and output throughput is calculated over the first-to-last content interval. If the upstream supports only buffered responses, TokenHub automatically falls back to buffered mode, marks TTFT as not applicable, and reports end-to-end output throughput instead of inventing a first-token measurement. Stopping a request preserves the partial text and marks the candidate as cancelled; authoritative token counts are shown only when the Provider returns them.

Rerunning an assistant turn creates another candidate for that turn and removes later turns so the new branch cannot silently reuse stale context. Changing models starts a new session by default; keeping the existing context requires an explicit choice. Parameter controls follow the selected model's declared `supported_parameters`, so the Playground does not send controls that the model catalog says are unsupported.

All permitted Playground users can see performance, usage, request ID, and their response details. Provider, resource, upstream request ID, and per-attempt routing details are visible only to roles with routing-read permission. Cost is labelled as an estimate because it uses the external model's configured price rather than an upstream invoice.

## Content Security Policies

Open **Security Policies > Content Security** to create policies for all Projects or selected Projects. A policy can combine keyword or regular-expression matching, sensitive-data detection, and the optional Qwen3Guard model detector. Detection items are evaluated together, and the strictest matching action wins: `block` over `mask` over `audit`. Changes take effect when saved.

Deterministic detectors run inside TokenHub. Before calling a configured Qwen3Guard detector, TokenHub replaces sensitive values already matched by local `mask` rules with `[REDACTED]` in a detector-only copy, so those raw values are not sent to the model service. Text not matched by a local mask rule is still sent to the service configured by `TOKENHUB_GUARDRAIL_MODEL_URL`. Deploy that service only within an approved data boundary and review its transport, logging, and retention controls; TokenHub cannot govern copies retained by a remote service. Leaving the URL empty prevents model calls and applies each model detection item's configured unavailable behavior.

Sensitive-data detection includes labelled or structurally validated examples such as Chinese identity-card numbers, mainland mobile numbers, email addresses, bank-card numbers, credentials and private keys, person names, addresses, and birth dates. Validators such as date checks, identity-card checksums, and Luhn checks reduce common numeric false positives. Use **Test Policy** with representative positive and negative samples before enabling a policy broadly.

Request-side enforcement currently covers `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/responses/compact`, and `/v1/messages`, including requests sent from Model Playground. TokenHub inspects ordinary user-visible text before routing to a Provider. Structured tool arguments, JSON payload values, code-specific parsing, and Provider responses are not inspected in this version. Inspection does not impose a separate text-size ceiling; the configured request-body limit still applies. Deterministic detection also applies complexity-weighted aggregate work and finding-count budgets so pathological combinations of long text, expensive expressions, or dense masking matches fail promptly with HTTP 503 `guardrail_evaluation_budget_exceeded` instead of monopolizing CPU or memory; ordinary long contexts with a moderate rule set remain supported.

When a policy blocks a request, compatible APIs return HTTP 403 with `guardrail_blocked`. The error details include `categories`, `reason_codes`, and `policy_matches`; each policy match identifies the policy, detection item, detector type, category, and reason code. The response also includes `request_id` for audit correlation. Original matched text is not included in the error details. Model Playground presents the same policy and reason information so administrators can report a reproducible finding instead of only seeing “Request blocked by a content security policy.”

## API Key Ownership and Usage Attribution

When issuing an API Key, select the actual user in **Owner User**. The issuer remains in audit metadata, but the Key's usage is attributed to its owner. Platform administrators may select any active user; team leaders may select an active user in their own team; ordinary users can only assign Keys to themselves.

Each new usage record snapshots the attributed user, so later ownership changes or Key deletion do not rewrite that recorded history. Records created before this field existed use only attribution that can be proven from their immutable usage record or request history; otherwise they remain `unknown`. Legacy quota buckets are retained as unattributed canonical history and are never silently assigned to the current owner during upgrade. The individual ranking shows distinct used Keys and currently owned non-revoked Keys separately.

The per-Key **Usage** page uses the saved Key ID as an exact boundary for trends, model and error breakdowns, and request details. Rotation links are informational and do not combine predecessor and successor usage. Its current day and month Key quota cards use UTC buckets and resolve the same global, project, team, and Key limits used for the gateway's per-Key admission checks. Aggregate user quotas are enforced separately and are not included in this per-Key view. Platform administrators additionally receive Provider and Resource performance breakdowns; other roles retain the existing scoped request-detail visibility, and Provider cost remains restricted to platform administrators.

## Daily Usage Dashboard

Open **Usage** to see the current day's usage above the longer-range executive report. The daily section shows today's tokens, requests, estimated cost, cache reads, and tables for token type, model, project, and API Key. Platform administrators also see Provider and Provider Resource tables; other roles receive only the remaining scoped dimensions. Team leaders also see member usage for their team, and governance roles see cost-center attribution.

The day boundary comes from **System Settings > Gateway Base Settings > Dashboard Timezone**. Use an IANA timezone such as `UTC`, `Asia/Shanghai`, or `America/New_York`. TokenHub stores this setting centrally, so all administrators see the same daily window and the dashboard resets at that timezone's local midnight. The usage view refreshes the daily section every 30 seconds while it is open.

## Read-only Cost Access for Local Agents

Do not give an automation agent an administrator session or a model-invocation API Key merely to collect usage. Create a dedicated `tha_` analytics credential, restrict it to one Project whenever possible, and revoke it independently. The [Agent Token Cost API guide](agent-token-cost-api.md) documents credential lifecycle, filters, aggregation, JSON/CSV schemas, snapshot pagination, incremental watermarks, audit behavior, and query limits.

## Per-Key RPM and TPM Limits

Each API Key can have optional requests-per-minute (RPM) and tokens-per-minute (TPM) limits. An unset or `null` value inherits the applicable global, project, and team policies. A value of `0` adds no Key-specific cap but cannot bypass an upper-level limit, while a positive value adds a Key-specific cap. When several positive limits apply, TokenHub enforces the strictest one. Disabling a Key rejects every request regardless of its limit values.

RPM is consumed before a Provider is invoked. TPM is reserved at the same point from the request's estimated input and maximum output; text requests without an explicit maximum reserve 4,096 output tokens. After the request finishes, the reservation is settled to the Provider's reported total tokens, or to prompt plus completion tokens when a total is unavailable. Cached and reasoning tokens are already included in those totals and are not added again. Failed or interrupted requests return the unused reservation.

An exceeded limit returns HTTP 429 with `api_key_rpm_exceeded` or `api_key_tpm_exceeded`, plus `Retry-After` and the relevant `X-RateLimit-Limit-*`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining-*`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset-*` headers. Minute buckets are database-backed. PostgreSQL shares enforcement across TokenHub instances; SQLite retains its supported single-backend behavior. Metrics expose only a short hashed Key reference, never the complete API Key.

For high-concurrency deployments, operators may configure `TOKENHUB_BILLING_REDIS_URL`. When set, TokenHub uses Redis for the high-write admission path: per-minute API Key and user RPM/TPM reservations plus API Key and user concurrency leases. The database remains the durable billing ledger for day and month counters, usage records, request logs, audit trails, and settlement idempotency. A configured Redis endpoint is required at startup; leave the variable empty to keep the database-backed admission path. Docker Compose deployments can add `deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml` to run an optional Redis component managed by the same Compose project.

## Aggregate User Quotas

Platform administrators and team leaders configure aggregate user limits under **Cost Governance > Quota Policies** by selecting `user` as the scope and an active user ID as `scope_id`. A team leader may manage policies only for users in the leader's own teams; platform administrators may manage any active user. The user selector lists the users available to the current administrator, and the policy table shows current daily and monthly consumption. User policies support the complete quota surface: RPM, TPM, daily and monthly requests, tokens and cost, plus maximum concurrency.

TokenHub resolves the attributed user with the same order used for usage accounting: API Key `owner_user_id`, then legacy Key metadata `created_by`, then Project `owner_user_id`. Every Key attributed to that user consumes the same user buckets, including Keys in different Projects. Rotating, revoking, deleting, or replacing a Key does not reset those counters because the buckets are owned by the user rather than the Key.

User limits are enforced alongside the applicable API Key, Project, Team, and global limits. Positive limits keep the existing strictest-value behavior, while user counters remain aggregate rather than becoming a per-Key allowance. User maximum concurrency is held in addition to the effective Key-scoped concurrency lease, so neither constraint can bypass the other.

Admission reserves user requests and estimated tokens before any Provider call. The shared settlement transaction reconciles the reservation to actual metered usage and uses the request ID as its durable idempotency marker for buffered, streaming, image, and background Responses calls. Background jobs persist their reservation state so cancellation, restart recovery, and stale workers cannot settle it twice. PostgreSQL uses transaction-scoped advisory locks and row locks across replicas; SQLite uses its single-backend transaction serialization. A blocked request returns HTTP 429 before Provider invocation with `details.scope` set to `user`. Audit payloads, alerts, and metrics retain that bounded scope without exposing the user ID or any API Key secret.

## Self-hosted compatible APIs

For a self-hosted service using the OpenAI-compatible adapter, leave the credential empty if the service does not require authentication. Connection testing, model discovery, and inference support this mode; no placeholder API Key is needed. If the service requires authentication, provide its real credential. When editing an existing Provider, leaving the field blank retains the saved credential; use the explicit remove-credential option to switch to unauthenticated access. Other adapters retain their declared authentication requirements.

Literal RFC1918/ULA HTTP endpoints such as `http://192.168.1.10:8000/v1` work by default. Loopback is allowed automatically only in auto mode with an empty private allowlist; otherwise it requires `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK`. Internal DNS names such as `host.docker.internal` require `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ACCESS_MODE=auto`. Existing nonempty private allowlists remain restrictive; see the deployment guide for strict mode and proxy policy.

## Provider Catalog Availability

TokenHub stores the last known-good provider catalog in the database. On every backend startup, it validates and loads the configured local `provider-catalog.json`, then atomically replaces the database snapshot. Ordinary **Provider Channels** requests only read the database snapshot. An explicit administrator refresh downloads the latest `PublicProviderConf` catalog, applies the same completeness checks, and atomically replaces the snapshot only when validation succeeds. If the upstream request or validation fails, TokenHub falls back to the configured local catalog. If that fallback also fails, the refresh returns an error and TokenHub keeps using the last known-good snapshot. Refresh responses identify the selected source as `upstream-provider-catalog` or `local-provider-catalog`.

## Codex OAuth Token Renewal

For active OpenAI Codex Subscription accounts that have a saved refresh token, TokenHub checks credentials when the backend starts and then every minute. It renews an access token only when it expires within five minutes. The database-backed credential lease ensures that a clustered deployment performs only one renewal for the account. In **Provider Channels > Advanced > Subscription quota**, **Renew Token** lets an administrator renew one account on demand. Use it for recovery rather than repeated clicks: a refresh response can rotate the refresh token, and TokenHub saves the returned replacement automatically. If OpenAI reports an invalidated refresh token, TokenHub marks the account as requiring reauthorization, stops scheduled renewal attempts, and shows the administrator a reauthorization prompt.

### Kronk local inference

Choose **Kronk** in **Provider Channels** to connect an independently running Kronk Model Server. The default Base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1`, which is allowed automatically only in auto mode with an empty private allowlist; otherwise it requires `TOKENHUB_PROVIDER_UPSTREAM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK`. When Kronk runs on another host, use a reachable private IP; that works in the default strict mode. Leave the application token empty when Kronk authentication is disabled; otherwise TokenHub sends the saved secret only as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Connection testing checks `/v1/liveness`, `/v1/readiness`, and `/v1/models` separately so a reachable process, a ready service, and usable local models remain distinct states.

The model picker discovers the live inventory from `GET /v1/models` and preserves each complete Kronk model ID, including `/`, `:`, and quantization suffixes. Import the selected inventory, then create the external standard name in **Model Directory** and map it to the Kronk ID under **Routing Policies**. Repeated imports are idempotent. A successful later discovery marks missing Kronk models unavailable without deleting their inventory or routes; a failed discovery leaves existing configuration unchanged.

Kronk routes support OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Responses, and Embeddings, including SSE streaming. TokenHub continues to enforce its client authentication, project isolation, quota, audit, routing, and failover policies. It never forwards the caller's `Authorization` header to Kronk and does not expose the saved Kronk token in management responses, audit payloads, logs, or upstream error responses.

### Dify applications

Create a Provider with type `dify` to expose a Dify application as a chat-completion model. Set the Base URL to the Dify instance root (a trailing `/v1` is accepted and normalized) and the API key to the application's Service API key from its API Access page. One provider maps to exactly one Dify app; the model routed to the provider is a TokenHub-local name, so create the external model in **Model Directory** and map it under **Routing Policies** as usual. The provider is created through the admin API with `"type": "dify"`, its app inventory imported as custom models, and connection testing validates the app key via `GET /v1/parameters` instead of a model listing.

Provider options control the app protocol:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dify_app_type` | `chat` (default) for Chatflow, Agent, and Chatbot apps through `/v1/chat-messages`; `workflow` for Workflow apps through `/v1/workflows/run` |
| `dify_input_variable` | Workflow input variable that receives the flattened conversation; default `query` |
| `dify_output_variable` | Workflow output variable that holds the answer; default `answer`, with `text`, `result`, `output`, or the sole string output accepted as fallbacks |

The gateway is stateless toward Dify: every request starts a new Dify conversation and the full OpenAI message list is flattened into the call, so Dify-side conversation memory is not used. Chat apps report full prompt, completion, and total usage from Dify's `metadata.usage`. Workflow runs report only the run total in `total_tokens`; TokenHub records it without inventing an input/output split, so per-component cost accounting for workflow-backed models depends on how that model is priced.

Streaming maps Dify SSE events onto OpenAI chunks: `message` and `message_end` for chat apps (Agent apps deliver the visible answer through `agent_message` instead), `text_chunk` and `workflow_finished` for workflows. A Dify stream that ends without its terminal event is treated as truncated rather than completed. Dify providers support chat and streaming chat only; Responses and embeddings answer `501 provider_capability_not_supported`.

To let a Dify app call models through TokenHub in the opposite direction, add an `OpenAI-API-compatible` model provider inside Dify pointing at the TokenHub `/v1` endpoint with a TokenHub API key. No TokenHub-side configuration is required.

## System Prompt Transform Handling

Claude Code can place an attribution text block at the start of an Anthropic Messages `system` array. The block contains client metadata that can vary between requests and prevent a third-party upstream from reusing an otherwise stable prompt prefix.

Each Provider has a `system_prompt_transform_policy` setting. Provider plugins declare their default with the `system_prompt_transform_default` provider policy capability. New third-party Providers default to `strip` for better upstream prefix-cache reuse unless their plugin declares another default. Existing Providers without this setting continue to preserve the block. The legacy `claude_code_attribution_policy` option and `claude_code_attribution_default` capability are still accepted as upgrade aliases. `strip` removes a block only when the first top-level `system` item has `type: "text"` and its text begins exactly with `x-anthropic-billing-header:`. String-valued `system` prompts, later blocks, leading whitespace, and other block types are never removed.

Provider Resources inherit the Provider policy by default and can override it with `options.system_prompt_transform_policy` set to `preserve` or `strip`. Omitting that Resource option restores inheritance. TokenHub applies the effective policy separately for every route attempt, so a failover Resource receives the original request and applies its own setting. Audit payloads also retain the original request. `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` continues to count the original request because it does not select a concrete Provider Resource.

## Codex Fingerprint Convergence

OpenAI Codex Subscription resources can converge client device and session identifiers before a Responses or Compact request is sent upstream. Configure **Codex fingerprint convergence** on the account resource. The default `session` mode derives stable account-level installation and session IDs, while deriving a stable thread ID from the original client session. `device` changes only the installation ID, `full` also converges all clients onto one thread, and `off` passes client identifiers through unchanged.

The policy rewrites matching fields in the Codex protocol headers and `client_metadata`, including embedded `x-codex-turn-metadata`, from one precomputed ID set so a request stays internally consistent across retries. In `session` and `full` modes, original parent, fork, and parent-turn lineage identifiers are removed because they belong to the pre-rewrite thread namespace. Stable values are derived from the Provider Resource ID and do not expose saved OAuth credentials. The setting is stored as `options.codex_fingerprint_mode`; the default `session` value is represented by an absent option. Set the mode to `off` to roll back to passthrough behavior.

## Codex Usage Reset Credits

For an active OpenAI Codex Subscription account, open **Provider Channels**, edit the Provider, and expand **Advanced > Subscription quota**. The account card shows the authoritative number of available reset credits and the nearest expiry reported by OpenAI. **Reset usage window** opens a second confirmation before it consumes one non-recoverable credit; it resets eligible Codex usage windows but does not change the ChatGPT billing plan. A completed or idempotently repeated operation refreshes both quota and reset-credit details.

Reset idempotency state is stored as `AdminResource` records of kind `codex-quota-reset-operations` in the existing admin-resources table, so this feature requires no schema migration. Succeeded and failed records are retained and are not automatically deleted because they prevent a replay from consuming another credit; include them in normal database retention and backups. During an upgrade, preserve the database. A `pending` or `unknown` record blocks a different reset for the same account, is shown to the console after restart, and may only be retried with the same idempotency key, expected count, and credit ID until OpenAI returns a definitive outcome.

## Provider Inventory, Model Directory, and Publication

TokenHub separates the model lifecycle into three control areas:

| Control area | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Provider Channels** | Upstream connections and their imported model inventory. Creating a catalog-based Provider requires selecting at least one model, but importing inventory alone never exposes it to clients. Custom Providers can be created empty and populated after the upstream connection is available. |
| **Model Directory** | Only the external models that form the API contract for applications. Creation starts by choosing a template from the built-in model reference catalog, or a blank custom model, then selecting one or more imported Provider models for its initial routes. Its prices are the unified client-facing prices, independent of which Provider route serves a request. |
| **Routing Policies** | Manage an external model's Provider mappings and fine-tune priority, weight, project scope, traffic allocation, and failover strategy. |

The responsibilities remain separate: add a Provider and import inventory first; then choose one of the built-in reference models, create its external contract, select at least one initial Provider route, and set its unified external price. The selected template pre-fills the name, capabilities, context, and suggested prices, all of which can be adjusted before saving. After creation, add, change, or remove mappings only under Routing Policies. Model Directory keeps a read-only upstream summary and opens Routing Policies filtered to the selected external model; the Provider list's Configure Routes action opens the complete Routing Policies workspace so new mappings can be added. For example, an administrator can expose the external model `DeepSeek` while routing it to `OpenAI Production / gpt-4.5`. The same Provider model may back several external aliases, and one external model may route to several Providers.

The built-in StepFun entries keep direct API and Step Plan credentials separate. `StepFun (China)` and `StepFun (Global)` use the pay-as-you-go `/v1` endpoints; `StepFun Step Plan (China)` and `StepFun Step Plan (Global)` use the subscription-only `/step_plan/v1` endpoints. Select the entry that matches the API Key environment because direct API and Step Plan keys and Base URLs are not interchangeable.

Provider-model prices represent actual upstream cost and are used for internal audit. Model Directory prices represent the unified external charge used for client billing estimates, quota accounting, metrics, and usage reports. A route selects the upstream implementation but does not change the external price.

When Provider Channels, Model Directory, or Routing Policies has no configured data, the console shows the same three-step setup guide: import Provider inventory, create an external model from the built-in model catalog, then configure routing. The primary action always points to the earliest incomplete prerequisite, so administrators are not sent into a form that cannot yet be completed.

Publication and runtime health are different states. Membership in `GET /v1/models` requires an active external `Model`, at least one active `ModelRoute`, and API-key access when a model allowlist is configured. It does not change when a Provider or Provider Resource is temporarily unhealthy. Health affects whether a request can be served and is shown separately in the directory and routing diagnostics. Disabling the external model removes it from `GET /v1/models` while retaining its mappings for later re-publication.

### GPT-6 Astra

The standard model directory and built-in OpenAI Provider inventory include `gpt-6-astra`. Select it when creating a model and configure an authorized upstream route; catalog inclusion does not grant upstream access. Codex subscription inventory remains account-discovered. Supported reasoning efforts are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`; Codex probes and Anthropic-to-Codex conversion preserve `max`.

The template uses OpenAI Standard prices per million tokens: $10 input, $1 cached input, $12.50 cache writes, and $50 output. Above 272,000 input tokens, OpenAI doubles input/cache rates and multiplies output rates by 1.5 for the full request. Provider tier metadata records this distinction; the standard template's fixed prices do not automatically apply context tiers or Batch/Flex/Fast discounts and surcharges. Configure applicable pricing separately. See [OpenAI model specifications](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-astra).


## Team-Owned Provider Channels

Provider Channels are either platform-owned or team-owned. A team-owned Provider carries an owner team, and only platform administrators plus leaders of that team can see and manage the Provider and its Provider Resources. Platform-owned Providers remain administrator-only.

| Concern | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Creation | A team leader creates Providers inside their own team automatically. An administrator may create a Provider without an owner (platform) or assign it to an existing team through `owner_team_id`. |
| Visibility | Team leaders see only their own team's Providers and Resources in lists and monitoring. Administrators see everything. |
| Ownership changes | `owner_team_id` cannot be changed through the regular update path; administrators reassign ownership by recreating the Provider. |
| ID reuse | Team leaders cannot create a Provider with an ID that already exists, because Provider creation upserts by primary key. |
| Egress control | Team-owned Providers pass through the same upstream access policy as platform channels: strict mode, the private CIDR allowlist, and the loopback opt-in. Team leaders cannot bypass it, and the egress probe endpoint stays administrator-only. |
| Deletion | Deleting a Provider removes its routes, imported inventory, resources, and observations in one transaction, for administrators and owning team leaders alike. |
| Routing | Routes inherit the provider's owner: team leaders may create, edit, and delete only routes that reference their own team's providers. The gateway serves a team-owned provider exclusively to projects whose primary team matches, so one external model can map to platform and several teams' channels at once. Model-level routing strategy, routing policy objects, and policy binding stay administrator-only, and routing simulation accepts only the leader's own team's projects. |

This is the foundation for delegated classrooms: a teacher brings their own upstream API configuration, manages accounts under it, and the routing layer can then scope model routes to that team.

## Teacher Self-Registration

The console login page can offer invite-code self-registration. In **System Settings → General Settings** (`cfg_gateway`), set `allow_self_registration` and an admin-issued `registration_invite_code`; the code is stored encrypted like other sensitive settings fields.

- Registration is disabled by default and fails closed when the toggle is on but no code is configured.
- A successful registration creates one team plus one `team_leader` account bound to it; the invite code is compared in constant time, and the public endpoint enforces a password policy (at least 10 characters with a letter and a digit) plus a per-IP attempt window.
- A duplicate username answers `409`; this reveals whether a username exists, matching the login endpoint's behavior.
- The whole flow is audited as a `register` event.

## Custom Upstream Request Headers

In **Provider Channels**, add fixed custom request headers under a Provider's connection settings or under a Provider Resource's advanced settings. Provider headers are defaults; a Resource header with the same case-insensitive name overrides the Provider value for that actual routing attempt. This makes per-account failover safe: TokenHub recomputes the effective headers for every selected Resource. For example, set `User-Agent: TokenHub-Custom-Client/1.0` at Provider scope and override `X-Tenant` on individual Resources.

The effective headers are applied consistently to connection tests, custom model discovery, OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Responses, Embeddings and Images (including streaming and image edits), native Anthropic Messages, and Gemini requests. Azure OpenAI and OpenAI Codex adapters do not support custom headers because they manage their own protocol identity.

Mark credentials or tenant tokens as sensitive. TokenHub encrypts sensitive values at rest, masks them in management responses and previews, and excludes header values from audit snapshots. When editing a saved sensitive row, leave its masked value unchanged or blank to retain the secret; delete the row to clear it. Non-sensitive values remain visible to administrators.

TokenHub rejects authentication headers, API-key and cookie credentials, forwarding identity headers, protocol-owned headers such as `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Host`, `Anthropic-Version`, `Anthropic-Beta`, `OpenAI-Organization`, and `OpenAI-Project`, plus hop-by-hop and transport headers. Header names must be valid and unique ignoring case; values must be non-empty and contain no control characters rejected by the HTTP transport. The final merged configuration may contain at most 32 headers, with names up to 128 bytes, each value up to 4 KiB, and 16 KiB total. Legacy data that violates these rules is reported with `header_validation_errors` and is not applied to upstream requests until corrected.

## Model Routing Policies

The admin console configures one routing strategy for the whole external model. Open the model card and select a strategy tab; the active tab explains its best use case, actual selection behaviour, parameter meaning, and a concrete example. Adjust the Provider parameters shown for that strategy, then choose **Apply Strategy**. The policy and every Provider parameter are saved atomically, so a model never runs with a partially updated configuration.

For fixed-ratio routing, enter the relative weight beside each Provider. Two Providers with weights 75 and 25 display target shares of 75% and 25%. Adaptive routing uses the same values as base weights and dynamically adjusts effective shares. Quality, cost, and balanced modes expose only their relevant scores. All of these strategies place eligible Providers in one traffic-allocation pool. Sequential failover is the only mode that uses Provider order; drag the rows to set first, second, and later choices.

| Strategy | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `priority_weighted` | Uses the configured weights as the target traffic ratio across routes at the same priority. For example, weights 75 and 25 target a 75:25 split over a representative request volume. |
| `adaptive` | Starts from the configured weights and adjusts the effective weights using invoked attempts from the last 15 minutes. A route begins adapting after 5 samples; recent success rate and successful-request latency influence its share, with bounded adjustments to prevent starvation or extreme shifts. |
| `quality` | Always tries the highest quality score first, with weight used only to break score ties. |
| `cost` | Always tries the highest cost-efficiency score first. A higher score means a cheaper, more preferred Provider. |
| `priority_only` | Uses the Provider list as a strict primary/backup order and does not distribute normal traffic. |
| `balanced` | Preserves legacy behaviour by using `weight + quality score + cost score` as the effective probabilistic weight. New configurations should normally use fixed ratio or adaptive routing instead. |

Provider connection details and project restrictions remain route-specific. Editing one Provider route changes its upstream model, project scope, sticky-session setting, or status; overall strategy, weight, and scores are edited in the model policy instead. `all` makes a route available to every project, `include` limits it to the selected projects, and `exclude` makes it available to every project except those selected. Project scope is evaluated before traffic allocation and failover, and displayed traffic shares are recalculated across the eligible Providers.

For a private-project boundary, create an internal Provider route with scope `include` and select the private projects. Create the corresponding external Provider route with scope `exclude` and select the same projects. The private projects can then use only the internal route, while other projects continue to use the external Provider.

Project route scope also controls model discovery: `GET /v1/models` includes an external model only when the calling API key's project has at least one active eligible route, in addition to the normal model and API-key allowlist checks.

### Scoped Routing Policies

Use **Scoped Policies** to bind an independent routing policy to the global gateway, a project, or an API Key. TokenHub resolves exactly one effective policy in this order: API Key, then project, then global. Finding a higher-priority binding ends resolution even when that policy is disabled, conflicting, or leaves no eligible candidate; the router fails closed and never falls back to a lower scope. Only one policy may be bound to a given target, while unbound definitions can be prepared without affecting traffic.

Model access is evaluated before routing. Projects and API Keys each support `inherit` and `restricted` access modes. A restricted list is intersected with every upper-level list, so an API Key cannot expand project access; a restricted empty list denies every model. For compatibility, records created before access modes existed that have a blank mode and an empty list continue to inherit. `GET /v1/models` applies the same effective access scope and requires a route allowed by the effective routing policy.

A scoped policy can constrain model names, Providers, Provider Resources, required route tags, resource regions, and resource environments, and can override the routing strategy. Configure tags on model routes and region/environment metadata on Provider Resources. Existing route-level project scopes are intersected with these constraints. Traffic allocation, session/cache affinity, half-open recovery, and failover run only after filtering and can never add an excluded route back to the candidate pool. This makes an internal-only policy fail safely instead of silently crossing to an external Provider.

The preview/simulation panel accepts a project, API Key, and model and displays the effective policy, access decision, selected route, and a safe allow/exclude reason for every candidate. Policy failures use diagnostic codes such as `routing_policy_unavailable`, `routing_policy_conflict`, and `routing_policy_no_candidate` without exposing credentials. Request logs record `routing_policy_id`, `routing_policy_scope`, and `routing_policy_priority`; generic policy create/update/delete operations and explicit bind/unbind operations also write administrator audit events.

The management API uses generic resource CRUD at `/api/admin/resources/routing-policies`, plus `POST /api/admin/routing-policies/{id}/bind`, `POST /api/admin/routing-policies/{id}/unbind`, and `POST /api/admin/routing-policies/simulate`. The same enforcement applies to OpenAI-compatible model requests, Anthropic Messages, image generation, and the administrator playground.

## Provider Resource Recovery

A provider resource that fails `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` times in a row is parked: it stops receiving traffic and enters a cooldown. Recovery is automatic and needs no admin action.

| Phase | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Parked | The resource is excluded from routing for `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` |
| Half-open | Once the cooldown lapses, exactly one request is allowed through as a trial; every other request is still rejected |
| Recovered | The trial reaching the upstream successfully clears the breaker, resets the failure count and raises a `provider_resource_recovered` alert |
| Re-parked | A failed trial immediately arms the next cooldown, doubling each time up to `TOKENHUB_RESOURCE_COOLDOWN_MAX_SECONDS` |

Only the trial request's own success closes the breaker. A request that was already in flight when the breaker tripped cannot close it, however it ends. What counts is decided by what the upstream failure proved about the resource, not by the status the caller was given. A client that disconnects mid-stream, a policy refusal, an unsupported model, a request the upstream rejected as malformed, and anything else that is about the request rather than the account count neither for nor against the resource: they add no failure, but they also clear none, so an alternating failure/disconnect pattern still trips the breaker. A rejected credential, an unpayable account, a rate limit and any upstream fault do count against it.

Testing a resource from the console still recovers it immediately when the adapter supports probing, because that probe issues a real upstream request. Disabling a resource remains an administrative override: a disabled resource is never readmitted by recovery, whatever the upstream reports.

## Upstream Error Classification

An upstream failure is graded on three separate questions, because one status code cannot answer all of them: what the caller is told, whether the router tries another candidate, and whether the attempt counts against the Provider Resource. A malformed request is malformed at every provider, so it is reported to the caller and no other candidate is tried. A rejected credential is specific to one account, so the request moves on and the account is blamed.

| Upstream | Caller sees | Error code | Another candidate | Counts against the resource |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `400`, `422` | the same status | `provider_invalid_request` | No | No |
| `401`, `403` | `502` | `provider_auth_error` | Yes | Yes |
| `402` | `502` | `provider_payment_required` | Yes | Yes |
| `404` | `502` | `provider_model_not_found` | Yes | No |
| `408` | `504` | `provider_upstream_timeout` | Yes | Yes |
| `413` | `413` | `provider_invalid_request` | No | No |
| `429` | `429` with `Retry-After` | `provider_rate_limited` | Yes | Yes |
| `502`, `503`, `504` | the same status | `provider_upstream_unavailable` | Yes | Yes |
| other `5xx` | `502` | `provider_upstream_error` | Yes | Yes |
| other `4xx` | `502` | `provider_error` | No | No |

An upstream `401` or `403` is not forwarded as such: it means the gateway's own credential for that provider was rejected, and a caller reading `401` would conclude their TokenHub API key had expired. For the same reason the upstream body is withheld on those two, since providers quote the rejected key back in it. The original status is recorded as `upstream_status` on each route attempt, where an operator can see it.

Every route attempt records both: `status_code` is what the caller was told, `upstream_status` is what the provider answered.

## Request Usage Audit

Each request row in **Request Logs** includes its total tokens and external billing amount. For administrators with global operations visibility, the detail panel also shows the Provider's actual cost calculated from the selected Provider model; other users do not receive that cost field. The panel retains the upstream billing breakdown when it is available: cached, cache-write, and audio input tokens, plus reasoning, audio, accepted-prediction, and rejected-prediction output tokens. Providers that do not return a field are shown as zero. Input and output totals already contain their detail categories, so do not add the detail values to the totals again.

## Metrics

TokenHub can expose Prometheus metrics at `GET /metrics`. Collection is off by default; set `TOKENHUB_METRICS_ENABLED=true` to enable it. While disabled, nothing is collected and the endpoint returns 404. The endpoint always authenticates: metrics disclose model names, provider and resource identifiers, and spend, so it is never anonymous. Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` using `TOKENHUB_METRICS_TOKEN`, or the admin token when that variable is empty. A dedicated token is recommended so the scrape configuration does not carry the admin credential. A token supplied in the query string is rejected, because it would be captured in access logs.

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tokenhub_gateway_requests_total` | counter | Logical model API requests. A request that failed over across several candidates counts once. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | End-to-end latency including failover attempts. Buckets run to 300s. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_route_attempts_total` | counter | Physical candidate attempts. The ratio `rate(route_attempts_total) / rate(routed_requests_total)` is the average failover depth; `routed_requests_total` counts only requests that made an attempt, so refusals that never reached a provider cannot dilute it. Labels include `invoked` so capacity-skipped candidates are visible separately. `status_code` is the gateway-mapped status (an upstream 401 is reported as 502); the raw upstream status is in the `RouteAttemptLog`. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_attempt_duration_seconds` | histogram | Duration of one invoked routed attempt, measured around the whole attempt: upstream transport, stream translation, and writing to the client. Streaming calls therefore include slow-client backpressure; gateway overhead is reported separately in `overhead_seconds`. Excludes candidates skipped for capacity. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_routed_requests_total` | counter | Logical requests that made at least one candidate attempt — the attempt-bearing denominator for the failover-depth ratio. Its `provider_type` label is the last candidate attempted, so when a request fails over across providers, aggregate the depth ratio by `model` rather than by `provider_type`. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_overhead_seconds` | histogram | Approximate gateway overhead: elapsed end-to-end time minus the sum of invoked attempt durations. Clamped at zero. A request admitted for routing that fails before any attempt contributes its full elapsed time. For image jobs the elapsed time includes queue wait, so overhead there is an upper bound. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_time_to_first_byte_seconds` | histogram | Client-perceived time to first byte for streamed requests, measured from local admission so failover retry time is included. Empty-body 200 responses record first byte at stream end. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_stream_interruptions_total` | counter | Streamed requests that failed after the first byte was written. `error_code` carries the final classified error code: HTTP-level upstream failures keep their code, while transport-level failures and client disconnects both collapse to `internal_error`. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_requests_in_flight` | gauge | Model API requests currently being served. Admin traffic and scrapes are excluded. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_tokens_total` | counter | Tokens by kind: `prompt`, `completion`, `cached`, `cache_write`, `reasoning`. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_cost_usd_total` | counter | Unified external billing estimate from Model Directory prices. Provider actual cost remains in privileged request audit rather than this metric. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_rate_limit_hits_total` | counter | Rejected requests by effective policy scope and limit type. `key_ref` is a short hash only for `api_key` limits; inherited global, project, and team limits use `none` to bound series cardinality. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_trace_completions_total` | counter | Finished calls by what trace export did with them: `converted` or `dropped`. Only present when tracing is on. |
| `tokenhub_gateway_trace_spans_total` | counter | Spans by what the OTLP exporter did with them: `exported` or `failed`. Only present when tracing is on. |

Go runtime and process metrics are exposed alongside them.

**Token kinds are not a partition and must not be summed.** `prompt` already contains the `cached` and `cache_write` tokens, and `reasoning` is a subset of `completion`. Summing the kinds double-counts.

Requests refused before routing — a bad API key, an exhausted quota, an unknown model — increment the request counter only. They never reached a provider, so they contribute no tokens, cost or duration. The attempt-bearing counterpart `routed_requests_total` counts only requests that reached at least one candidate, so a rejection burst does not dilute the failover-depth ratio. A model name that the catalog does not know is reported as `unknown` rather than verbatim, so a client looping over invented model names cannot inflate the series count.

Labels are `model`, `provider_type`, `provider_id`, `resource_id`, `status_code`, `error_code` and `stream`. Upstream failures no longer report a single `provider_error` at `status_code="502"`; they carry the codes and statuses listed under Upstream Error Classification, so dashboards and alerts that match on the old pair need updating. Upstream failures no longer report a single `provider_error` at `status_code="502"`; they carry the codes and statuses listed under Upstream Error Classification, so dashboards and alerts that match on the old pair need updating. Setting `TOKENHUB_METRICS_PROJECT_LABEL=true` adds `project_id`, which multiplies the series count of every gateway metric by the number of active projects; leave it off unless you need per-project dashboards, and use the usage reports for per-key attribution instead.

Useful PromQL examples:

```promql
# Average failover depth per model.
sum by (model) (rate(tokenhub_gateway_route_attempts_total[5m]))
/
sum by (model) (rate(tokenhub_gateway_routed_requests_total[5m]))

# 99th percentile gateway overhead. Histograms must be aggregated by bucket
# before calling histogram_quantile; subtracting aggregated percentiles is
# mathematically invalid.
histogram_quantile(
  0.99,
  sum by (le, stream) (rate(tokenhub_gateway_overhead_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)
```

When running multiple gateway instances, histogram quantiles can be computed from `sum(rate(..._bucket)) by (le)` across all instances because each bucket is a counter. `tokenhub_gateway_requests_in_flight` is a gauge and should be aggregated with `instance` if you want per-instance concurrency; summing it across instances gives total in-flight requests.

To push metrics instead of having them scraped, point an OpenTelemetry Collector's `prometheus` receiver at this endpoint and forward from there. Traces are a separate signal and are pushed directly; see below.

## Trace Export

TokenHub can export one OpenTelemetry trace per gateway call over OTLP/HTTP. Each trace is a root span for the request plus one generation span for every candidate that entered the invocation path, so a failover shows both candidates with the tokens and cost each of them consumed. A candidate skipped for lack of capacity never reached a provider and is recorded as an event on the root instead. Metrics tell you that latency rose; a trace tells you which account served the request and what it cost. Export is off by default: it sends operational data to another system.

Set `TOKENHUB_TRACING_ENDPOINT` to the signal-specific OTLP traces URL, including its full path. It is used verbatim — nothing is appended — because a guessed path suffix fails as a silent 404 rather than as a startup error. A URL without a path, or one carrying a query, fragment or userinfo, is rejected at startup rather than quietly exported somewhere else. Any OTLP/HTTP backend works; no OpenTelemetry Collector is needed, because the gateway speaks OTLP over HTTP directly rather than gRPC.

For Langfuse:

```bash
TOKENHUB_TRACING_ENABLED=true
TOKENHUB_TRACING_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel/v1/traces
TOKENHUB_TRACING_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic $(printf '%s' 'pk-lf-...:sk-lf-...' | base64),x-langfuse-ingestion-version=4"
```

The attribute mapping targets the Langfuse v4 ingestion model, which is generally available for self-hosted deployments and the default for Langfuse Cloud organizations created after 2026-04-14. Self-hosting Langfuse v4 requires ClickHouse 25.12 or newer alongside PostgreSQL, Redis and object storage. TokenHub does not bundle Langfuse into its own Compose files: that is a second stateful stack with its own upgrade cycle, and coupling the two would make a Langfuse migration a gateway outage.

Whether prompts and responses are exported is a separate decision from whether tracing is on, and `TOKENHUB_TRACING_CAPTURE_PAYLOADS` is off by default. With it off a trace still carries status, latency, the provider and resource that served each attempt, tokens, cost, transport and upstream request IDs. With it on, request and response bodies go through the same redaction and truncation as the stored payload log, and upstream error text is treated as payload for the same reason: an upstream error can embed a response body, a URL or an account identifier.

Usage and cost are attached to the generation spans and never to the root. Langfuse v4 aggregates over observations, so repeating them on the root would double every token and every dollar in the project totals. Token counts are also rewritten into mutually exclusive buckets on the way out. TokenHub's input and output totals already contain their detail categories — cached, cache-write and audio input; reasoning, audio and prediction output — while Langfuse sums the buckets it is given, so each detail is subtracted from its total and capped by what remains. The cost exported is the billed figure only; the Provider's own cost stays in the privileged request audit, where TokenHub deliberately confines it.

![A failover trace in Langfuse: the root request span, two failed attempts on the unreachable account, and the generation that served it with its own token count and cost](assets/screenshots/tracing-langfuse-trace-en.png)

Trace and span IDs are both derived from the request ID, so the `x-request-id` header returned to a client leads straight to its trace without a lookup table. That is a lookup convenience and not a deduplication guarantee: Langfuse can still create a duplicate observation for a span ID it has already seen. Export retries are therefore disabled and delivery is at-most-once — a batch lost to a transient failure is not resent. For traces carrying token counts and spend, inflated cost is the worse failure, and this pipeline already drops rather than waits when it is saturated. Playground traffic is exported with a `playground` tag so it can be excluded from cost analysis, and requests refused before routing are exported too, since a quota or admission failure is usually what you are trying to explain.

![The Langfuse trace list showing gateway, playground and rejected traffic side by side, filterable by tag](assets/screenshots/tracing-langfuse-list-en.png)

Export never delays a request. Completions are queued and turned into spans on a separate goroutine; when the queue is full the completion is dropped rather than made to wait. Drops are counted in `tokenhub_gateway_trace_completions_total` with `outcome="dropped"` and logged at most once a minute, so a gap in Langfuse is distinguishable from a gateway that received no traffic. Delivery is counted separately in `tokenhub_gateway_trace_spans_total`, because a full queue and a backend that refuses every batch are different problems with different fixes. Image generation jobs are not traced yet: they complete asynchronously on a worker and need their own idempotency design first.

## Prompt Cache Pricing

The model catalog accepts optional cache-read and cache-write prices in USD per 1 million tokens. When cache-write pricing is not configured, TokenHub bills cache-write tokens at the normal input price to preserve legacy estimates. Providers that distinguish cache creation duration can also use `cache_write_5m_price_usd_per_1m` and `cache_write_1h_price_usd_per_1m`; remaining cache-write tokens use the generic cache-write price. When cache-read pricing is left blank, TokenHub estimates it at about 0.83% of the standard input price for DeepSeek V4 Pro, 2% for other DeepSeek models, and 10% for other non-embedding models. The model pricing table marks estimated values and explains the applied ratio on hover.

Usage records expose `input_cost_usd`, `cache_read_cost_usd`, `cache_write_cost_usd`, and `output_cost_usd` alongside the total `estimated_cost_usd`, so reports can audit how the final charge was assembled from provider usage.

Model records and Provider model inventory also accept `pricing_periods`: a JSON array of time-based price overrides. Each period may include an IANA `timezone`, local `start_time` and `end_time` in `HH:MM`, optional RFC 3339 `effective_from` and `effective_until`, and input or output price fields. Pricing is selected from the request start time and the first matching period wins; windows may cross midnight.

## Catalog Metadata Recovery

Deleting an external model removes its database record and routes, but it does not edit `data/model-catalog.yaml` or the file configured by `TOKENHUB_MODEL_CATALOG_FILE`. Backend startup synchronizes tracked catalog metadata from that file again; administrators can trigger the same synchronization without a restart from **Settings → Base Settings → Sync Model Reference Catalog**. This synchronization does not import a model for a Provider, create a route, or publish it in `GET /v1/models`; those remain explicit administrative actions in their respective control areas.

## External Billing Connectors

Platform administrators manage external billing sources from **Cost Billing**. TokenHub supports Aliyun `QueryInstanceBill`, NewAPI quota data, and OneAPI-compatible log sources. A connector can be tested, synchronized immediately, scheduled at a minute interval, disabled without deleting its history, and re-enabled later. Configure the TokenHub Provider ID and, when the bill represents one account, the optional TokenHub resource-account ID; reconciliation uses this persisted scope so usage from another Provider or account cannot enter the result.

For Aliyun, configure the billing RPC base URL, AccessKey ID, AccessKey Secret, source time zone, and optional product code. TokenHub signs each RPC request with HMAC-SHA1 and advances across billing cycles. For NewAPI, configure the base URL, access token, `New-Api-User` ID, currency, and the quota units that equal one currency unit. TokenHub calls `GET /api/data/self` with the documented authentication headers and automatically splits ranges into windows of at most 30 days. For OneAPI-compatible sources, configure the base URL, API token, log path, currency, and quota conversion. All connectors accept a per-second request limit; synchronization uses bounded exponential retries for temporary network, `429`, and `5xx` failures.

Manual synchronization may specify `from` and `to` RFC 3339 timestamps. Without an explicit range, TokenHub continues from the last successful end time. It saves the provider cursor after every page, so a retry resumes the failed range rather than starting over. Normalized records use `(connector_id, external_id)` as the idempotency key and retain currency, source time zone, tax, discount, refund, billing period, and usage timestamps. Recent runs show pages, request attempts, inserted and updated records, and a sanitized failure code.

Connector credentials and raw billing snapshots are AES-GCM encrypted with `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`. They are not returned by admin APIs or written to audit payloads. Keep that key stable across restarts and replicas. The relevant endpoints are `GET/POST /api/admin/billing/connectors`, `PATCH /api/admin/billing/connectors/{id}`, `POST /api/admin/billing/connectors/{id}/test`, `POST /api/admin/billing/connectors/{id}/sync`, `GET /api/admin/billing/records`, and `GET /api/admin/billing/sync-runs`.

## Cost Reconciliation

Platform administrators can compare synchronized Provider bills with TokenHub usage from **Cost Billing → Cost Reconciliation Rules**. A rule selects one billing connector, detail/hour/day/month granularity, matching dimensions, an IANA time zone, one ISO currency, absolute and ratio tolerances, a detail time window, a billing-delay window, and an optional schedule. Currency is always a matching dimension, so separate rules are required for separate currencies. Because TokenHub usage costs are stored in USD, each rule records a fixed `1 USD = target currency` exchange rate; USD rules require a rate of `1`. Optional Provider-side mappings normalize external Provider, resource-account, model, and project values to TokenHub identifiers. Detail rules require `request_id`; aggregate rules can group by Provider, resource account, model, project, and currency. NewAPI billing data has no request-level identifier, so NewAPI connectors support hour, day, and month rules but not detail rules. Manually entered period times are interpreted in the rule's IANA time zone before they are sent to the API.

Running a rule for a selected period produces matched, Provider-only, TokenHub-only, and amount-mismatch counts, totals for both sides, the difference, likely causes, and drill-down source record IDs. Monetary values accumulate at sub-micro precision and are rounded to at most six decimal places only when results are stored or displayed. Detail matching first maximizes the number of one-to-one pairs within the configured window, then minimizes their total time distance; TokenHub records just outside a period boundary can still match an in-period Provider bill. Provider records are selected by their usage time rather than ingestion time, so late-arriving bills remain attributable to the original period. Scheduled runs close the most recent complete hour, day, or month after the configured billing delay.

Each result stores the complete rule snapshot, rule version and hash, input hash, actor, timestamps, and audit events. Recalculation uses the stored rule snapshot. If recalculation fails, the last successful run and its items remain available and the failed attempt is audited. If the source rows are unchanged, the input hash and classified amounts are reproducible. Lock a successful result to prevent later recalculation. Detail rows are fetched with server-side `limit`/`offset` pagination. CSV exports stream all difference rows in bounded batches by default, without a silent row limit; Provider credentials and raw snapshots are never included, resource-account identifiers are masked in API and CSV output, and resource-account mappings are omitted from audit snapshots.

The relevant endpoints are `GET/POST /api/admin/billing/reconciliation-rules`, `GET/PATCH /api/admin/billing/reconciliation-rules/{id}`, `POST /api/admin/billing/reconciliation-rules/{id}/run`, `GET /api/admin/billing/reconciliations`, `GET /api/admin/billing/reconciliations/{id}`, and the `{id}/lock`, `{id}/recalculate`, and `{id}/export` actions. These endpoints are restricted to platform administrators.

The `audit_retention` gateway setting accepts only `Nd` values from `1d` through `3650d`. Once per UTC hour, the cluster deletes request and response payload bodies older than the configured period in bounded batches. Request log metadata, usage analytics, administrator audit events, and alert events are not deleted by this setting.

## Security Checklist

| Control | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| API keys | Show the full secret once, then store only prefix and suffix |
| OAuth redirect URI | Register local and production callback URLs with the identity provider |
| RBAC | Separate user, team leader, administrator, finance, security, and operator scopes |
| Audit retention | Keep request logs and admin events long enough for compliance review |
| Cost controls | Attribute every request to user, project, team, and cost center when possible |

## Chinese Enterprise Identity Sources

In **Identity Sources**, select a built-in DingTalk, Feishu, or WeCom template. The template fills the public endpoints and claim mappings; only override the advanced endpoints when traffic must pass through an enterprise proxy or a compatible private deployment.

Creating an identity source uses three required steps: choose the source, enter its connection settings, and configure the login entry plus first-login grants. The connection step links to the selected provider's official setup guide so you can create the application and obtain its credentials. Generic OIDC and OAuth2 templates instead tell you to consult the actual provider's application-registration guide and link to the relevant protocol reference. From the third step, templates with complete endpoint defaults can use **Skip and Finish**; otherwise the advanced endpoint fields become required. You can also open advanced settings to override endpoint, scope, and claim defaults. Editing an existing source keeps the complete form available on one screen.

Use the public TokenHub backend URL with the callback path `/api/admin/auth/oauth/callback`. You may leave Callback URL blank to derive it from the incoming backend host; when setting it explicitly, the complete URL must exactly match the redirect URL registered with the identity provider.

Completing an administrator OAuth login never puts the administrator session token in a redirect URL. TokenHub returns a short-lived, single-use code to the console, which exchanges it once and keeps the resulting session only in the current browser tab. Reloading that tab preserves the session; closing it requires signing in again.

Identity-source client secrets and notification-channel credentials, including webhook URLs, SMTP passwords, bot tokens, signing secrets, and access tokens, are masked in management API responses and CSV exports and redacted from audit snapshots. Alert-delivery output never exposes a complete credential-bearing URL: URL targets retain only the scheme and host, while paths, queries, and matching credentials in error text are masked. This protection also applies to alert-delivery CSV exports and delivery audit snapshots.

When updating an identity source or notification channel, the following values mean "keep the stored secret": an empty string, the masks `********` and `••••••••`, and `[redacted]`. Send JSON `null` to clear a secret explicitly. Clearing a notification-channel secret also removes related aliases, such as `url` / `webhook_url`, `smtp_password` / `password`, and the channel-specific token or secret aliases. Only platform administrators can create, update, or delete identity sources; security administrators have read-only access to the masked configuration.

| Provider | Required application configuration | TokenHub behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DingTalk | Create a web application, enable user authorization, register the callback URL, and copy its App Key and App Secret | Uses the DingTalk v1.0 JSON token API and user access-token header. If the authorized profile has no email, TokenHub derives a stable internal email from `unionId`. |
| Feishu | Create an enterprise self-built application, enable web authorization, register the callback URL, and copy its App ID and App Secret. Grant profile and enterprise-email access when available. | Uses the Feishu OAuth v2 token API and unwraps the `data` user-info response. If email is unavailable, TokenHub derives a stable internal email from `union_id`. |
| WeCom | Create a custom application and configure its trusted web authorization domain. Copy the Corp ID, application Secret, and Agent ID, and grant the application permission to read the required directory members. | Uses WeCom CorpApp login, exchanges the application token, resolves the callback code to `UserId`, and then reads the member profile. `biz_mail` is preferred; a stable internal email is derived from `userid` when needed. |

The derived addresses end in `<provider>.tokenhub.local`. They are internal account identifiers, not deliverable mailboxes. Keep a controlled password administrator until the new login has been tested end to end.

## Email Notification Channels

Notification channels of type `email` are delivered over SMTP. By default
TokenHub connects in plaintext and upgrades to STARTTLS on the server's
advertised capabilities (typically port 587). For mail servers that only expose
SMTP over an implicit-TLS port such as 465, set the channel field
`smtp_encryption` to `ssl`, `tls`, `smtps`, or `implicit` to open the connection
with TLS from the first byte. The channel keeps the other standard fields
(`smtp_host`, `smtp_port`, `smtp_username`, `smtp_password`, `smtp_from`,
`email_to`).

In the admin console's email channel form, the **SMTP encryption** selector
offers `auto` (opportunistic STARTTLS, legacy default), `starttls` (require
STARTTLS, refuse to send when unsupported, port 587), and `ssl` (implicit TLS
from the first byte, port 465); new channels default to `starttls`. Selecting
`auto` leaves `smtp_encryption` unset so the legacy opportunistic STARTTLS
behavior is preserved; only `starttls` and `ssl` write the field.
