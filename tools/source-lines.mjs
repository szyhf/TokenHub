/**
 * Files already over the ceiling when the gate landed. Test files are deliberately
 * included rather than exempted, matching the stance .golangci.yml already takes on
 * errcheck in tests: a 4,900-line test file is as hard to review as a 4,900-line
 * source file.
 *
 * Raising an entry is deliberately not something `--update` can do. It only lowers,
 * so every increase lands as a visible diff a reviewer has to agree to — which is the
 * whole point of a ratchet. Every entry below records the size the file has on `main`,
 * which this branch has had to re-measure twice: once for the image generation feature
 * and again for the project workspace, native release and version update work that
 * merged while this gate was in review. `frontend/features/admin/i18n/ja.tsx` is frozen
 * for the first time here — it crossed 1,500 lines on `main`, where the frontend-only
 * checker this gate absorbs had already recorded it.
 *
 * Every baseline here is above DEFAULT_MAX_LINES, and that is an invariant rather than
 * a coincidence. A frozen entry may only ever relax the default; once a file is split
 * back down to the default limit it graduates out of the table entirely, because the
 * default already covers it. `--update` removes graduated entries, and `allowedFor`
 * floors any baseline at the default so a hand-edited low number cannot turn this
 * table into a stricter-than-default limit on one file.
